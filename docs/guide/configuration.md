# Configuration reference

Copperline is configured by a TOML file: `./copperline.toml` by default, or
any file passed with `--config`. Every field is optional; missing fields use
the defaults documented here. `copperline.example.toml` in the repository
root is a commented companion to this reference.

The configuration is validated up front and the emulator refuses to start
with a clear error message rather than guessing (unknown CPU or chipset
names, out-of-range sizes, missing disk images, and so on).

### Paths on Windows

This applies to every path field below (`rom`, disk images, hard-drive
files, the SCSI ROMs, and so on). In a TOML double-quoted string the
backslash is an escape character, so a Windows path written the obvious way
(`rom = "C:\Kickstarts\KICK31.ROM"`) is rejected: `\K` is not a valid escape.
Use any one of:

```toml
rom = 'C:\Kickstarts\KICK31.ROM'    # single quotes: a literal string, no escaping
rom = "C:\\Kickstarts\\KICK31.ROM"  # double quotes: backslashes doubled
rom = "C:/Kickstarts/KICK31.ROM"    # forward slashes also work on Windows
```

Single-quoted literal strings are the least error-prone. macOS and Linux paths
use forward slashes and need none of this.

## Command-line overrides

The most common machine knobs can be set on the command line without writing
a config file. These flags layer on top of the config file (or, when there is
none, the built-in defaults) and are validated by exactly the same parsers and
range checks as the equivalent TOML fields:

| Flag | Overrides | Accepts |
|---|---|---|
| `--model NAME` | `[machine] profile` | `A1000`, `A500`, `A500OCS`, `A500Plus`, `A600`, `A1200`, `A3000`, `A4000`, `CDTV`, `CD32` |
| `--chipset NAME` | `[chipset] revision` | `OCS`, `ECS`, `AGA` |
| `--cpu MODEL` | `[cpu] model` | `68000`, `68010`, `68EC020`, `68020`, `68030`, `68040`, `68060` |
| `--cpu-clock MHZ` | `[cpu] clock_mhz` | a number of MHz |
| `--fpu` / `--no-fpu` | `[cpu] fpu` | fit / omit a 68881/68882 |
| `--chip SIZE` | `[memory] chip` | `512K`, `1M`, `2M`, ... |
| `--fast SIZE` | `[memory] fast` | `0`, `1M`, `4M`, `8M`, ... |
| `--slow SIZE` | `[memory] slow` | `0`, up to `512K` |
| `--motherboard SIZE` | `[memory] motherboard` | Ramsey RAM (A3000/A4000): `0`, `1M`..`4M`, `8M`, `12M`, `16M`; A4000 up to `64M` |
| `--accelerator SIZE` | `[memory] accelerator` | CPU-slot RAM at `$08000000` (32-bit CPUs): `0` to `128M` |
| `--floppy-drives COUNT` | `[floppy] drives` | `1` to `4` wired drives (`DF0:` plus external drives) |
| `--floppy-speed PERCENT` | `[floppy] speed` | `100` (real), `200`, `400`, `800`, or `0` (turbo) |
| `--joystick MODE` | `[input] joystick` | `gamepad` (default), `keyboard` |
| `--mouse-sensitivity N` | `[input] mouse_sensitivity` | `0`-`100` host mouse speed (`50` default = 1:1) |
| `--mouse-capture MODE` | `[input] mouse_capture` | When the host mouse is grabbed: `click` (default), `auto`, `manual` |
| `--port1 DEVICE` | `[input] port1` | `mouse` (default), `joystick`, `cd32`, `analogue`, `none` |
| `--port2 DEVICE` | `[input] port2` | same devices; default `joystick` (`cd32` on the CD32 profile) |
| `--autofire HZ` | `[input] autofire_hz` | `0` (off, the default) to `30` |
| `--full-screen` / `--windowed` | `[display] full_screen` | open fullscreen or windowed at start (default windowed) |
| `--show-status-bar` / `--hide-status-bar` | `[display] status_bar` | status bar at start (default shown) |

For example, to boot a stock A1200 profile but with 8 MB of fast RAM and a
faster CPU, with no config file at all:

```sh
./target/release/copperline --model A1200 --fast 8M --cpu-clock 28 KICK31.ROM
```

A `--model` profile supplies the chipset, CPU, and memory defaults of a real
machine; the other flags then override individual values on top of it, just as
explicit `[cpu]`/`[chipset]`/`[memory]` sections override a `[machine]`
profile in a config file.

The audio, serial, parallel, and network surface has matching per-run flags
too -- `--audio-device`, `--audio-channel-mode`, `--audio-filter`,
`--audio-stereo-separation`, `--serial`, `--midi-in`, `--midi-out`,
`--parallel`, `--sampler-audio-input`, `--sampler-input-gain`, `--a2065-net`,
`--a2065-interface` --
described with their `[audio]`, `[serial]`, `[parallel]`, and `[a2065]` keys
below.

## Top level

```toml
rom = "KICK13.ROM"            # Kickstart image, 512 KiB (or a 256 KiB 1.x part)
extended_rom = "cd32ext.rom"  # optional: CDTV (256K at $F00000) or
                              # CD32 (512K at $E00000) extended ROM
# identify = false            # drop the Copperline identification board
                              # from the Zorro chain (default: present)
```

`identify` controls a small, inert Zorro autoconfig board Copperline puts on
the expansion chain (manufacturer 5192 / product 2) so guest software such
as [identify.library](https://github.com/shred/identify) can detect that it
is running under the emulator. It is on by default and does not change the
machine's usable memory; set `identify = false` for a chain with no
emulator-identifying board. See [](../zorro) for details.

The ROM path can be overridden by a positional CLI argument. Omit `rom`
entirely (and pass no ROM argument) to boot the bundled AROS open-source
Kickstart replacement, which ships with Copperline as the default boot ROM;
its main and extended halves are located next to the binary (under
`share/copperline/aros` for a Homebrew install) or set
`COPPERLINE_AROS_DIR`. You can also fit a different ROM at runtime from the
menu's **Load Kickstart ROM...** item, which hard-resets the machine. Machine
profiles that need an extended ROM (CDTV, CD32) will tell you if it is
missing.

Both ROM keys accept images in either byte order. Alongside plain CPU-order
dumps, the byte-swapped images prepared for EPROM programmers -- the
single-chip `.bin` ROM files in Hyperion's Kickstart 3.1.4/3.2 releases, such
as `kick.a500a600a2000.46.143.bin`, store every 16-bit word with its bytes
exchanged -- are recognised from their header and restored on load, so either
file boots identically. A 256 KiB Kickstart 1.x part is mirrored across the
512 KiB ROM window, as it decodes on real hardware. The split `hi`/`lo` chip
pairs for the 32-bit machines are not accepted; use the matching single-file
image instead.

## `[machine]` -- machine profiles

```toml
[machine]
profile = "A1200" # A1000, A500, A500OCS, A500Plus (A500+), A600, A1200, A3000, A4000, CDTV, CD32
rtc = true        # add a battery RTC (default: only A500+/CDTV/A3000/A4000 ship with one)
# rtc_chip = "RP5C01"              # MSM6242 (default) or RP5C01 (A3000/A4000 default)
# rtc_time = "2005-03-18 01:58:29" # seed the clock; it then ticks in emulated time
# rtc_frozen = true                # stop the seeded clock at rtc_time exactly
# battmem = "battmem.nvram"        # RP5C01 battery-RAM backing file (default when fitted)
mem_controller = "ramsey-07" # none, ramsey-04 (A3000), ramsey-07 (A4000)
rom_scsi_device_disable = true # skip the ROM's scsi.device (default: when its bus has no drives)
```

A machine profile bundles the chipset, CPU, memory, gate array, and
peripheral defaults of a real machine. The key is `profile` (the deprecated
`model` alias still parses) so it never collides with `[cpu] model`. Explicit `[cpu]`, `[chipset]`, and
`[memory]` sections override individual profile defaults. Without a
`[machine]` section you get the A500 Rev 6A default (the same as the `A500`
profile: ECS 8372A Agnus, OCS 8362 Denise, 68000, 512K chip RAM, 512K
trapdoor slow RAM) -- the most common and most-targeted Amiga. An explicit
`[chipset] revision` overrides the per-machine chips, so `revision = "OCS"`
gives a plain 8371/8362 OCS machine.

| Profile | Chipset | CPU | Chip RAM | Slow RAM | Extras |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `A1000` | OCS (8361/8367 Agnus, OCS Denise) | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 256K | 0 | WCS, boot ROM + Kickstart disk |
| `A500` | Rev 6A: ECS 8372A Agnus, OCS 8362 Denise | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 512K (up to 1M) | 512K | -- |
| `A500OCS` | OCS (8371 Fat Agnus, OCS Denise) | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 512K | 512K | early A500 / A2000 |
| `A500Plus` | ECS (8375 Agnus, ECS Denise) | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 1M | 0 | RTC |
| `A600` | ECS (8375 Agnus, ECS Denise) | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 1M | 0 | Gayle IDE |
| `A1200` | AGA (Alice/Lisa) | 68EC020 @ 14.18 MHz | 2M | 0 | Gayle IDE |
| `A3000` | ECS | 68030 @ 25 MHz | 2M | 0 | Ramsey-04, RP5C01 RTC |
| `A4000` | AGA (Alice/Lisa) | 68040 @ 25 MHz | 2M | 0 | Ramsey-07, RP5C01 RTC |
| `CDTV` | ECS | 68000 @ 7.09 MHz | 1M | 0 | DMAC CD controller, RTC, 256K extended ROM |
| `CD32` | AGA (Alice/Lisa) | 68EC020 @ 14.18 MHz | 2M | 0 | Akiko, CD32 pad, NVRAM, 512K extended ROM |

`rtc` exists because most Amigas shipped without a battery-backed clock and
only some carried one. The `A500Plus` (an OKI RTC soldered to the Rev 8A
board), `CDTV`, `A3000`, and `A4000` fit one by default; the base
A500/A500OCS, A600, A1200, A1000, and CD32 have none. Set `rtc = true` to add
one -- for an A600HD or a clock-equipped A1200, say -- so the Workbench clock
keeps time.

`rtc_chip` names the part in that socket, because Commodore used two with
different register protocols: the OKI **MSM6242** on the small boxes, the
CDTV, and the aftermarket clock expansions, and the Ricoh **RP5C01** on the
A3000/A4000 motherboards (the Ricoh also carries 26 nibbles of battery RAM,
which AmigaOS uses via `battmem.resource` on those machines). The default
follows the profile -- `RP5C01` on `A3000`/`A4000`, `MSM6242` everywhere else
-- and setting the key implies `rtc = true`. AmigaOS probes for either part,
so the choice is mostly invisible to it, but Linux/m68k does not probe: it
drives the chip the machine model dictates, so an A3000/A4000 booting Linux
needs the RP5C01 answering for its clock to work.

`battmem` persists the RP5C01's battery-backed registers -- the 26 RAM
nibbles behind `battmem.resource` plus the alarm and 12/24 settings --
across runs, the way the real board's battery does. This is where
`scsi.device` keeps its per-unit SCSI host settings (an A3000's or A4091's
synchronous-transfer, disconnect, and last-drive options, including
remembering attached CD-ROM drives), so without it those revert every run.
The file uses the same `.nvram` layout as WinUAE and Amiberry, so backing
files interchange between emulators; only the battery payload loads back --
the time-of-save digits in the file never override the (host- or
`rtc_time`-driven) clock. It defaults to `battmem.nvram` in the working
directory whenever an RP5C01 is fitted; point it elsewhere with a path, or
set `battmem = ""` to keep the battery registers session-only. Note that a
persisted file carries guest-visible state from one run into the next by
design, so delete it (or disable it) where byte-for-byte reproducible
headless runs matter.

`rtc_time` seeds the clock instead of letting it mirror the host's: the value
is either an integer (Unix seconds, UTC) or a string
`"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS]"` giving exactly the wall-clock time the guest reads
at power-on. A seeded clock ticks with *emulated* time, so the time the guest
sees is deterministic and reproducible byte-for-byte across runs -- the way
to test time-dependent guest software (TOTP/RFC 6238 vectors, timestamped
logs, date rollovers) or just to boot into a fixed date. Setting a time
implies `rtc = true`; combining it with an explicit `rtc = false` is an
error. `rtc_frozen = true` additionally stops the tick so every read returns
`rtc_time` exactly. Both are also available as `--rtc-time` / `--rtc-frozen`
CLI flags, and a control-protocol session can inspect and move the clock live
with `rtc.get` / `rtc.set` (see `docs/debugger/control.md`).

Two guest-side notes: Kickstart 2.0+ loads the system time from the battery
clock automatically at boot, while Kickstart 1.3 only does so when the
startup-sequence runs `SetClock LOAD`; and the chip's two-digit year registers
mean AmigaOS applies its usual century window, so seeds outside 1978-2077
will not read back as the year you set. A host-initiated reset or power
cycle restarts the emulated timeline and therefore restarts a seeded clock
from `rtc_time`; a guest-initiated reboot (the 68000 `RESET` instruction)
leaves it ticking, like real battery-backed hardware.

The `A3000` and `A4000` profiles are the big-box machines. They carry a
Ramsey memory controller (`mem_controller`), which is what the two registers
at `$DE0003` and `$DE0043` answer as, and they carry Gary rather than Gayle
-- so no PCMCIA and no Gayle IDE.

- The **A3000** has its motherboard SCSI: a Super DMAC at `$DD0000` driving a
  WD33C93, which Kickstart's own `scsi.device` initialises at boot. Attach
  drives to it with `[scsi] controller = "a3000"` (the default controller on
  an A3000; see the `[scsi]` section below).
- The **A4000** has its motherboard IDE interface at `$DD2020`; attach drives
  with `[ide]`, exactly as on a Gayle machine.

`rom_scsi_device_disable` skips Kickstart's built-in disk driver. It defaults
on when the machine's own controller -- the IDE port of an A600, A1200, or
A4000, or the A3000's SCSI -- has no drives configured: with nothing to boot,
the driver only costs startup time probing an empty bus. Configuring a drive
turns the driver back on automatically (it is the boot path for those
drives), and setting the flag explicitly wins in either direction. The ROM
file itself is never modified.

Both profiles fit their stock 4M of Ramsey-controlled motherboard fast RAM;
`[memory] motherboard` resizes it up to 16M, and on the A4000 up to 64M
via the motherboard RAM expansion space (see the `[memory]` section).
`[memory] accelerator` adds CPU-slot RAM at `$08000000` on any 32-bit
machine.

`mem_controller` is normally left to the profile. It is broken out because
Ramsey's registers collide with nothing else, so it can be fitted to
a wedge machine to exercise diagnostic tools that expect one.

The `A1000` profile models the original Amiga, which has no Kickstart ROM.
Its `rom` is instead the 64K bootstrap ROM ("Amiga ROM Bootstrap"); on
power-up the bootstrap loads Kickstart from the Kickstart disk in DF0 into
256K of writable control store (WCS) at `$FC0000`, write-protects it, and runs
it -- exactly as the real machine does. So an A1000 config names the bootstrap
ROM as `rom` and puts the Kickstart disk in `[floppy.df0]`; leave it in and the
machine boots to Kickstart (which then asks for a Workbench disk). See the
ready-made `a1000.example.toml`.

The `A500` profile models the common Rev 6A board: the ECS "Fatter" 8372A
Agnus (a 1 MiB chip-RAM reach and the software-selectable PAL/NTSC switch via
`BEAMCON0`) paired with the original OCS 8362 Denise. It is therefore an
Agnus-only ECS upgrade, not a full-ECS machine -- the OCS Denise means no
superhires or `BRDRBLNK`, exactly as on the real board. Chip RAM defaults to
the stock 512K but accepts up to 1M (`[memory] chip = "1M"`); more than 1M is
rejected because the 8372A cannot address it. Booting with no `[machine]`
section uses the same Rev 6A defaults; select `A500OCS` or set
`[chipset] revision = "OCS"` for the older 8371/8362 machine.

## `[emulation]`

```toml
[emulation]
power_on = true            # false = start powered off at the test screen
pacing_budget = "cycles"   # "cycles" (hardware-accurate) or "instructions"
realtime_priority = false  # true = raise the pacer/audio thread priority
warp_speed = "max"         # turbo limit: "2x", "4x", "8x", "16x", or "max"
rewind = false             # true = record rewind history from power-on
rewind_budget_mb = 256     # host memory the rewind history may hold
rewind_interval_frames = 25 # emulated frames per rewind step
```

The deterministic cycle-driven core is the only emulation timing. It is
paced to wall-clock for the interactive window and runs unthrottled for
headless captures; the emulated result is identical. (An older `speed` key
here is accepted but ignored -- "real" was the only timing model, so it
carried no information.)

- `power_on = false` starts the machine powered off showing a test screen
  until you click the status-bar power button -- useful for arming video
  capture first. The power button cold-boots (clears RAM).
- `pacing_budget` selects how real-time pacing budgets CPU work per frame:
  `"cycles"` (default) charges each instruction its actual 68000 cycle cost
  plus chip-bus waits, matching real hardware speed; `"instructions"` uses a
  flat `COPPERLINE_REAL_CPU_CPI` (default 4.0) cycles/instruction quota,
  which is cheaper but runs the CPU faster than hardware.
  `COPPERLINE_REAL_PACING_BUDGET` overrides this for one run. See
  [](../internals/timing) for the full rationale.
- `realtime_priority = true` asks the OS to schedule Copperline's two
  latency-critical threads -- the wall-clock pacer and the audio callback --
  above normal, which reduces frame stutter and audio glitches when the host
  is busy. It is best effort and off by default, and never fails the run:
  - **macOS** -- the pacer thread joins the `USER_INTERACTIVE` QoS class. The
    audio callback is left alone because Core Audio already runs it on a
    real-time thread (overriding that would only demote it).
  - **Windows** -- both threads are raised via `SetThreadPriority`; no
    privilege required.
  - **Linux/other Unix** -- raising priority needs privilege (an `rtprio`
    rlimit, `CAP_SYS_NICE`, or root). Without it the request is logged and
    declined, and the thread keeps normal scheduling.

  `COPPERLINE_REALTIME_PRIORITY` overrides this for one run; set it to
  `0`/`false`/`off` to force it off, or to any other value (or leave it empty)
  to force it on.
- `warp_speed` sets the default speed of Warp Speed (turbo) mode. The window
  presents with vsync, so emulating one frame per presented frame would pin
  warp to the host monitor's refresh rate. This option is an output frame
  skip -- `"2x"`, `"4x"`, `"8x"`, `"16x"`, or `"max"` (default) -- so warp
  retires that many emulated frames per presented frame, making warp roughly
  the limit times the refresh rate (host CPU permitting). `"max"` runs flat
  out and still presents at vsync. Adjust it live from the **Warp Limit**
  menu item or `Cmd+Shift+W` / `Alt+Shift+W` (see [The window and its
  controls](ui.md)).
- `rewind = true` records rewind history from power-on, so `Cmd+Z` / `Alt+Z`
  and the **Rewind** menu item can step the whole machine backward through
  it. It rides the same deterministic snapshot ring as the debugger's reverse
  controls (see [](../debugger/reverse)) and is off by default because it is
  not free: `rewind_budget_mb` (default 256) of host memory holds the
  snapshots, and one whole-machine serialize happens every
  `rewind_interval_frames` (default 25, half a second of PAL). One rewind
  step goes back exactly one interval; oldest snapshots are evicted first, so
  how much emulated time the budget buys scales with the machine's RAM size.
  Turning the menu item off releases the retained snapshots. The same
  determinism preconditions as reverse debugging apply -- a real-time clock
  and host disk writes are not rolled back.

## `[cpu]`

```toml
[cpu]
model = "68000"     # 68000, 68010, 68EC020, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060
clock_mhz = 14.0    # optional; defaults to the model's stock speed
# icache = false    # instruction-cache model (on by default on all 020+ models)
# dcache = false    # data-cache model (on by default: 030/040/060)
# fpu = true        # fit a 68881/68882 (68020/68030; needs the coprocessor
#                   # interface, so not valid on a 68000). The full 68040's
#                   # and 68060's on-die FPUs are enabled by default.
# unimplemented = "trap"  # 68060 only: "trap" (faithful; the OS needs
#                   # 68060.library) or "native" (execute the removed
#                   # instructions directly)
```

- `model`: the 68010 models the vector base register, the format-stacking
  exception model, and DBcc loop mode; the 68EC020 is a 68020 instruction
  set with a 24-bit external address bus.
- `clock_mhz` defaults to the model's stock speed (68000/68010 ~7.09, 020 ~14,
  030/040 ~25, 060 50) and is modelled as a whole multiple of the colour clock
  (3.546895 MHz). Fast RAM and ROM run at the CPU clock; chip and slow RAM
  stay chip-bus bound, so overclocking speeds up only what a real
  accelerator would speed up.
- `icache`/`dcache` model the on-chip caches and default **on** for the
  silicon that has them (instruction cache on the 020/68EC020/030/040/060,
  data cache on the 030/040/060), matching real hardware where AmigaOS
  enables them via CACR. The cache is sized to the CPU: 256 bytes on the
  020/030, 4 KB on the 040, 8 KB on the 060. Set either to `false` to opt
  out.
- `unimplemented` (68060 only) picks what happens on the instructions the
  68060 dropped from silicon: MOVEP, CHK2/CMP2, CAS2, misaligned CAS,
  64-bit MUL/DIV, and most of the FPU beyond basic arithmetic
  (transcendentals, FMOVECR, packed decimal). `"trap"` (the default) is
  what the chip does - they raise the unimplemented-instruction exceptions
  and the OS-side `68060.library` emulates them, exactly as on a real
  CyberStorm or Blizzard board, so software using them needs that library
  installed. `"native"` executes them directly for systems without it.
  Kickstart 3.1 itself boots fine under `"trap"`. `fpu = false` on the
  68060 models the LC/EC060: FP instructions take the FPU-disabled
  exception (PCR.DFP), which an OS handler can also use to enable and
  restart. The 68060's superscalar dual-issue and branch cache are
  modelled and activate when system software enables them (PCR.ESS and
  CACR.EBC, which `68060.library` does at boot); until then the chip runs
  scalar, as on real silicon. This is not cosmetic: code that loops
  out of chip RAM otherwise contends with bitplane DMA on every instruction
  fetch and can run at roughly half speed, which is why an AGA demo's music or
  animation may pace correctly only with the cache modelled. The data cache
  caches expansion RAM/ROM only, since chip and slow RAM are DMA-visible and
  cache-inhibited as on real Amigas.

## `[memory]`

```toml
[memory]
chip = "512K"        # OCS max 512K; ECS/AGA max 2M
fast = "0"           # Zorro II fast RAM at $200000: 64K..8M board sizes
slow = "512K"        # A500 trapdoor RAM at $C00000: 0 or up to 512K
motherboard = "0"    # Ramsey motherboard RAM (A3000/A4000): up to 16M (A4000: 64M)
accelerator = "0"    # CPU-slot RAM at $08000000 (32-bit CPUs): up to 128M
z3   = "0"           # Zorro III RAM (needs a 32-bit CPU): 64K..1G, power of two
```

Sizes accept `K`/`KB`/`M`/`MB` (and `G`/`GB` for Zorro III) suffixes or
plain byte counts, and must be multiples of 4 KiB.

- **Chip RAM** is range-checked against the chipset: 512K on OCS, 2M on
  ECS/AGA (also bounded by the selected Agnus revision's address reach).
- **Fast RAM** is exposed as a Zorro II autoconfig board at `$200000`, so
  it must be a legal Zorro II board size: 64K, 128K, 256K, 512K, 1M, 2M,
  4M, or 8M.
- **Slow RAM** ($C00000 "ranger" RAM) is arbitrated on the chip bus through
  Agnus exactly like chip RAM -- it is slow in the authentic way.
- **Motherboard RAM** is the 32-bit local memory Ramsey drives on the
  A3000/A4000: it ends at `$08000000` and grows downward (16M reaches
  `$07000000`), and Kickstart sizes it with its own probe -- no autoconfig
  involved. It needs a Ramsey (`[machine] mem_controller`, fitted by the
  A3000/A4000 profiles, which also fit their stock 4M of this RAM by
  default) and a 32-bit CPU, and must fill whole Ramsey banks: 1M-4M in
  1M steps, or 8M, 12M, 16M. On the A4000 (Ramsey-07), sizes beyond 16M
  keep growing downward into the `$04000000`-`$06FFFFFF` motherboard RAM
  expansion space, in 4M steps up to 64M (which reaches `$04000000`).
  Set `motherboard = "0"` to remove it.
- **Accelerator RAM** is CPU-slot local memory: it starts at `$08000000`
  and grows upward through the coprocessor-slot expansion space, up to
  128M (ending at `$10000000`, where Zorro III space begins). This is the
  RAM an accelerator/CPU board carries, so it needs a 32-bit CPU but no
  particular machine profile; any whole number of megabytes fits.
  Kickstart sizes it with its own probe, like the motherboard bank.
- **Z3 RAM** requires a 68020/68030/68040/68060 (a 24-bit bus cannot reach it);
  Kickstart assigns its base address, usually `$40000000`.

Additional expansion boards can be described with `[[zorro]]` metadata
files; see [](../zorro).

## `[chipset]`

```toml
[chipset]
revision = "OCS"   # OCS, ECS, or AGA preset
video = "PAL"      # PAL or NTSC
# agnus = "8372A"  # optional fine-grained override
# denise = "OCS"   # optional fine-grained override
```

`revision` is a preset; `agnus` and `denise` allow the mixed configurations
real machines shipped with (a late A500 with an ECS Agnus but OCS Denise,
for example):

- `agnus`: `OCS`/`8370`/`8371` (OCS), `8372`/`8372A` (ECS, 1M chip),
  `8375`/`8372B` (ECS, 2M chip), `8374`/`ALICE` (AGA).
- `denise`: `OCS`/`8362`, `ECS`/`8373`, `LISA`/`4203`.

The ECS preset picks an 8372A for up to 1M chip RAM and an 8375 above; the
A600 profile always uses the 8375 as the real machine did. The AGA preset
resolves to Alice and Lisa: 8 bitplanes, the 256-entry 25-bit palette with
BPLCON3 BANK/LOCT banking, HAM8, FMODE wide bitplane and sprite fetch
(DMA and manual sprites), SSCAN2/BSCAN2 scan doubling, BPLCON4, and
CLXCON2 (remaining gaps, such as true 35 ns SuperHires sprite output, are
recorded in [](../internals/chipset)).

## `[display]`

```toml
[display]
overscan = "tv"       # "tv" (default) or "full"
pixel_aspect = "tv"   # "tv" (default, 4:3 CRT) or "square" (exact 2x2 lo-res)
deinterlace = true    # motion-adaptive interlace weaving (default true)
phosphor = 0.0        # CRT persistence fraction, 0.0 (off) to 0.95
shader = "none"       # "none" (default), "scanlines", "mask", "crt", or a .wgsl file
shader_strength = 1.0 # how strongly the shader is mixed in, 0.0-1.0
tint = "none"         # "none" (default), "bw", "green", "amber", or "sepia"
full_screen = false   # open fullscreen at start (default false)
status_bar = true     # show the status bar at start (default true)
```

The emulated framebuffer always carries the full overscan field Denise
produces. `"tv"` masks the deep horizontal overscan margins in black like a
CRT bezel, presenting the standard window plus 24 lo-res pixels per side
of TV-style overscan while preserving vertical border colour changes. PNG
screenshots and `--dump-frames` crop standard TV output to a 692x540
aperture for reference-emulator comparison; PAL and NTSC scans share the
one shape because both apertures fill the same 4:3 glass -- an NTSC scan's
shorter crop (the 200-line standard window plus the same overscan margin)
is scaled onto the same output rows. The live window shows a slightly
narrower cut of the same aperture, clipped to the columns the framebuffer
actually captures, so the picture sits exactly centred on screen with no
one-sided black margin. `"full"` shows everything, which
is useful when debugging display alignment. `COPPERLINE_OVERSCAN=full|tv`
overrides this for a single run. In both modes the presentation geometry
holds steady across the blank frames a screen change produces: a frame
showing only border colour keeps the previous frame's aperture and
centring instead of snapping to the full framebuffer, so the picture does
not jump sideways at Kickstart screen changes.

`pixel_aspect` selects how emulated scanlines map to host rows. The default
`"tv"` presents the field with the non-square pixel aspect of a 4:3 CRT:
the full overscan scan fills a 4:3 picture, so PAL lo-res pixels come out
slightly wider than tall, exactly as a real TV shows them (a 320x256 screen
spans about 640x482 window pixels). `"square"` uses one host row per woven
scanline instead, so every low-resolution pixel is an integer 2x2 square
and a 320x256 PAL screen occupies precisely 640x512 window pixels --
slightly taller than a real CRT picture, but exact for side-by-side pixel
comparison with square-pixel emulators. The menu's *Pixel Aspect* item
flips the mode live without touching the config, and
`COPPERLINE_PIXEL_ASPECT=tv|square` overrides it for a single run.

`deinterlace` controls how interlaced (LACE) displays are presented. On
(the default), a motion-adaptive deinterlacer weaves the two fields into a
full-height picture where the content is static and interpolates where it
moves, recovering the full vertical resolution without combing. Off, every
field is simply line-doubled as it arrives, which shows interlace bob and
flicker much as a TV without persistence would. `COPPERLINE_DEINTERLACE=0`
overrides the config for a single run.

`phosphor` blends each presented frame with a fraction of the previous
one, approximating the exponential decay of CRT phosphor. Software that
relies on the tube to fuse field-rate flicker -- alternate-field dither
transparency or flicker-dithered animation -- reads as intended with values
around `0.3`-`0.5`,
at the cost of a slight motion trail. Off by default so screenshots and
frame dumps stay frame-exact. `COPPERLINE_PHOSPHOR=0.4` overrides the
config for a single run.

`shader` runs a GPU shader pass over the window's picture, for the tube
look a phosphor trail on its own cannot give. Three presets are built in:

- `"scanlines"` -- the line structure a 15 kHz set leaves between beam
  passes: a raised-cosine gap at the pitch of the emulated lines, with the
  brightness the gaps cost compensated back so the picture dims only
  slightly rather than by half.
- `"mask"` -- a shadow mask. The picture is modulated through staggered RGB
  phosphor triads keyed to physical window pixels, so the mask keeps its
  size whatever the Amiga resolution behind it, again
  brightness-compensated.
- `"crt"` -- the lot, in the spirit of the 1084 the Amiga shipped with: a
  bowed tube face, scanlines that follow the bow, an aperture grille, and a
  corner vignette, all faded in together.

`"none"` (the default; `"off"` is accepted for the same thing) presents the
picture untouched, and any value ending in `.wgsl` is the path of a shader
of your own -- see [Custom WGSL shaders](#custom-wgsl-shaders) below.

The scanline gaps are drawn at the pitch of the emulated field lines the
window is actually showing: 270 in the default TV-overscan presentation
(214 on an NTSC scan) and 285 in `"full"`, so the line structure follows
the picture rather than the window size. TV overscan with `pixel_aspect = "square"` is 285 as well --
that canvas is taller than the TV aperture and pads it with bezel rows, so
the same 270 lines are rescaled to keep their pitch across the whole
window. Interlaced content is deliberately drawn at field-line pitch
over the woven frame, which is what a 15 kHz set fed an interlaced signal
looks like, rather than one gap per woven row.

`shader_strength` (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) is how strongly the effect is
mixed in, so a preset can be dialled back without editing shaders. At `0.0`
the shader arithmetic is an exact no-op, but the pass still resamples the
picture through a plain bilinear sampler, which is a shade softer than the
texel-snapped pass-through the window otherwise uses at magnification.
`"none"` skips the pass altogether and is the only truly zero-cost setting.

The menu's *CRT Shader* item cycles the presets live for the rest of the
session without touching the config file; the launcher's *A/V & Emu* tab
(*Video* category) has *CRT shader* and *Shader strength* rows that do
write it.
`COPPERLINE_SHADER=crt|scanlines|mask|none|PATH.wgsl` and
`COPPERLINE_SHADER_STRENGTH=0.0..1.0` override the config for a single run.
There is no command-line flag.

The pass is presentation and nothing else. Screenshots
(`--screenshot-after`), frame dumps (`--dump-frames`), video recordings, the
[control protocol](../debugger/control.md)'s capture methods and the web
frontend all read the CPU presentation buffer, which the shader never
touches, so captures stay comparable whatever is selected here. Individual
frames also skip the pass in three cases: while a menu or overlay panel is
open (a phosphor mask and a curved face make overlay text unreadable), for
frames coming from an RTG board's scanout (see `[rtg]` below), and for
programmable multisync scan modes -- a 31 kHz scanout has no 15 kHz line
structure to reproduce.

`bezel` (default `false`) frames the window's picture with a monitor-style
front bezel, also in the spirit of the 1084: the picture scales down into
the rounded opening of a procedurally drawn plastic face -- warm-grey
moulding, a dark recess around the tube face, rounded case corners, and the
wider bottom band carrying the power LED and a printed Copperline logotype
in the spot the 1084 kept its Commodore badge. The frame is drawn at the window's
resolution, so it stays sharp at any size, and the picture keeps its aspect
inside the opening. It is independent of `shader` and composes with any
preset: with `"crt"` the bowed tube face sits inside the opening for the
full monitor look. Cmd+M (macOS) / Alt+M toggles it live for the rest of
the session without touching the config; the launcher's *Monitor bezel* row
(*A/V & Emu*, *Video*) writes it, and `COPPERLINE_BEZEL=1|0` overrides the
config for a single run.

Like the shader pass, the bezel is presentation and nothing else: captures
never include it, and it is skipped while a menu or overlay panel is open
and for RTG scanout frames. Unlike the shader it does stay on for
programmable multisync scans -- a frame has no line structure to get wrong.

`tint` recolours the picture like the phosphor of a monochrome monitor:
`"bw"` (black and white), `"green"` and `"amber"` (the two classic
monochrome phosphors), or `"sepia"`; `"none"` (the default; `"off"` is
accepted) presents full colour. The same five looks the web frontend's
*Screen* selector offers, produced by the same colour chain, so a tint
chosen in the browser matches the desktop. It composes with `shader` --
green phosphor under the `crt` preset makes a convincing monochrome tube.
Like the shader, the tint is presentation only: screenshots, frame dumps,
recordings and headless runs stay untinted, the status bar and overlay
menus keep their colours, and RTG board scanout (the monitor on the
board's own output, not the Amiga's video output) is never tinted. The
menu's *Screen Tint* item cycles the tints live for the rest of the
session without touching the config file; the launcher's *A/V & Emu* tab
(*Video* category) has a *Screen tint* row that does write it.
`COPPERLINE_TINT=bw|green|...` overrides the config for a single run.

### Custom WGSL shaders

Pointing `shader` at a `.wgsl` file loads a fragment shader of your own into
the same pass. The quickest start is to copy one of the presets --
`src/video/window/shaders/scanlines.wgsl`, `mask.wgsl` or `crt.wgsl` in the
source tree -- and edit its `fs_main`: everything above the
`--- end shared contract ---` marker in those files is the contract, and is
byte-identical in all three.

A shader must declare exactly these bindings and both entry points:

```wgsl
struct CrtUniforms {
    // Display sub-rect of src_tex in UV space: xy origin, zw size.
    src_rect: vec4<f32>,
    // xy: viewport size in physical pixels. zw: source display texels.
    size: vec4<f32>,
    // x: strength, 0 (no-op) to 1 (full). y: scanline count across the
    // display height. zw: preset-internal, do not rely on them.
    params: vec4<f32>,
    // Preset-internal and reserved; zero for a custom shader.
    params2: vec4<f32>,
};

@group(0) @binding(0) var src_tex: texture_2d<f32>;
@group(0) @binding(1) var src_samp: sampler;
@group(0) @binding(2) var<uniform> u: CrtUniforms;

struct VOut {
    @builtin(position) pos: vec4<f32>,
    @location(0) uv: vec2<f32>,
};

@vertex
fn vs_main(@builtin(vertex_index) idx: u32) -> VOut {
    // Fullscreen triangle; the viewport restricts it to the display rect.
    let tc = vec2<f32>(f32((idx << 1u) & 2u), f32(idx & 2u));
    var out: VOut;
    out.uv = tc;
    out.pos = vec4<f32>(tc * vec2<f32>(2.0, -2.0) + vec2<f32>(-1.0, 1.0), 0.0, 1.0);
    return out;
}

// Sample the display region only, clamped half a texel inside src_rect so
// a linear tap on the bottom edge never blends in the status bar's first
// row underneath it.
fn sample_display(uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec4<f32> {
    let half_texel = 0.5 * u.src_rect.zw / max(u.size.zw, vec2<f32>(1.0));
    let lo = u.src_rect.xy + half_texel;
    let hi = u.src_rect.xy + u.src_rect.zw - half_texel;
    let tc = clamp(u.src_rect.xy + uv * u.src_rect.zw, lo, hi);
    return textureSample(src_tex, src_samp, tc);
}

@fragment
fn fs_main(in: VOut) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    let uv = clamp(in.uv, vec2<f32>(0.0), vec2<f32>(1.0));
    let base = sample_display(uv);
    let strength = clamp(u.params.x, 0.0, 1.0);

    // Your own look goes here. This one is a green monochrome monitor with
    // a gap between beam passes at the emulated line pitch.
    let lines = max(u.params.y, 1.0);
    let profile = 0.5 - 0.5 * cos(6.283185307 * uv.y * lines);
    let luma = dot(base.rgb, vec3<f32>(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));
    let tube = vec3<f32>(0.2, 1.0, 0.35) * luma * (0.6 + 0.4 * profile);

    // Mixing back toward the untouched sample keeps strength 0 a no-op.
    return vec4<f32>(mix(base.rgb, tube, strength), 1.0);
}
```

Points worth knowing:

- All three bindings are fragment-visibility only. `vs_main` cannot read
  them, so all the work happens in `fs_main`.
- Sampling goes through `src_rect`. The pass draws over the display
  rectangle of a texture that also carries the status bar below it, and the
  half-texel inset is what keeps the status bar's separator hairline out of
  the bottom of a magnified picture.
- Of the uniforms, a custom shader can count on `src_rect`, `size`,
  `params.x` (strength) and `params.y` (scanline count). `params.z`,
  `params.w` and `params2` carry the built-in presets' own look parameters,
  are zero for a custom shader, and are reserved for future use.
- Making strength `0.0` a visual no-op is a convention, not something the
  loader enforces, but the *Shader strength* control and
  `COPPERLINE_SHADER_STRENGTH` are only useful if you honour it.

The file is read and checked when the window is created, when the launcher
starts a machine, and every time the menu's *CRT Shader* item cycles onto
**custom** -- which re-reads it from disk. That is the live-reload story:
leave the emulator running, edit the shader, then cycle the menu item away
from custom and back to see the new version.

Checking is a parse, a full validation, and a look for the two entry points,
all before any GPU pipeline is built, so a mistake is reported as WGSL with
its line and column rather than as a driver error. Files over 1 MiB are
refused unread, on the grounds that a shader that big is a mistyped path.
Whatever goes wrong -- a missing file, a syntax error, a missing `fs_main` --
the full diagnostic goes to the log, a one-line summary appears in the
window's on-screen message, and the shader falls back to off. A bad custom
shader never fails the config, and never stops the machine from running.

`full_screen` opens the window fullscreen at start (borderless), and
`status_bar` chooses whether the status bar starts visible. Both are start-up
preferences; the runtime toggles -- `Cmd+F` / `Alt+F` for fullscreen and
`Cmd+Shift+F` / `Alt+Shift+F` for the status bar, plus their menu items --
still flip either live without changing the saved value. On the command line
`--full-screen` / `--windowed` set the fullscreen state and `--show-status-bar` /
`--hide-status-bar` set the status bar; the launcher's A/V & Emu page (Video
category) has *Start fullscreen* and *Status bar* toggles for the same. Left
unset they keep the defaults: windowed, status bar shown.

Rendering completed frames uses a worker thread by default so emulation can
advance while the previous frame is painted. The worker is an implementation
detail of presentation: screenshots, frame dumps, and recordings wait for
the exact frame they save. `COPPERLINE_THREADED_RENDER=0` forces the old
synchronous render path for comparison.

## `[audio]`

```toml
[audio]
floppy_sounds = true        # synthesized drive sounds (not sampled)
floppy_sounds_volume = 100  # 0-100, relative to Paula's output
# output_device = "..."     # host output device (substring); omit = system default
# output_enabled = true     # false = no sound (GUI "Disabled"); --audio/--noaudio still win
channel_mode = "stereo"     # "stereo" (default) or "mono"
stereo_separation = 100     # 0-100; 100 = hardware panning, 0 = mono
audio_filter = "auto"       # Paula filter: "auto" (guest-driven), "on", or "off"
```

The drive sounds are generated from scratch: motor hum with spin-up/down
over a rumble that repeats with each platter revolution, and head-step
clacks (an isolated step -- the empty-drive poll, or the track-to-track
advance while loading -- lands with its rebound clatter, and fast
multi-track seeks blur into the characteristic buzz). Reading adds no
noise of its own; the loading sound is the step rhythm over the spinning
motor, as on the real mechanism. The synthesis targets were measured
from recordings of real Amiga drive mechanisms, but no sample data is
used. Only step pulses that actually fire the stepper are audible: like
a real 3.5" mechanism, an outward pulse with the head at track 0 is
gated by the /TRK0 sensor, so NoClick-style patches silence the
empty-drive poll just as they do on real hardware.

`output_device` picks the host output by a case-insensitive substring of the
names `--list-audio-devices` prints (`--audio-device` overrides it); an omitted
or unmatched name uses the system default. `channel_mode = "mono"` averages the
left and right output into both channels, and `stereo_separation` narrows the
Amiga's hardware left/right panning between full (100) and mono (0) -- so it is
ignored when `channel_mode` is mono. `output_enabled = false` runs with no sound
at all (the launcher and runtime-menu "Disabled" option); the `--audio` and
`--noaudio` CLI flags still override it. These are host-output settings that do
not change the emulated audio and are not stored in save states. The equivalent
CLI flags are `--audio-device`, `--audio-channel-mode`, `--audio-stereo-separation`
and `--list-audio-devices`.

`audio_filter` controls Paula's analogue low-pass filter, the one a
post-A1000 Amiga switches with the same CIA-A line that drives the power
LED. `"auto"` (the default) lets the guest engage or bypass it as the
software asks, matching real hardware; `"on"` and `"off"` force it either
way as a listener override. Unlike the host-output settings above it is
part of the emulated audio path, so it also affects WAV capture. Also on
`--audio-filter`, the runtime **Audio Filter** menu item, and Cmd/Alt+A.
The status-bar PWR LED is lit whenever the machine is powered and follows
the guest's /LED line itself -- full brightness while engaged, dimmed like
an A500 rev 6+ board while released -- so this override changes what you
hear, never the LED.

On Linux with PipeWire/PulseAudio, individual sinks are not ALSA devices, so
only the `default`/`pipewire` route is offered; pick the output in the desktop
sound settings (or route Copperline in `pavucontrol`) and it follows. macOS and
Windows select each device directly.

## `[input]`

```toml
[input]
port1 = "mouse"           # mouse | joystick | cd32 | analogue | none
port2 = "joystick"        # same values; default "cd32" on the CD32 profile
joystick = "gamepad"      # "gamepad" (default) or "keyboard"
mouse_sensitivity = 50    # host mouse speed 0-100 (50 default = 1:1)
mouse_capture = "click"   # when to grab the mouse: click | auto | manual
autofire_hz = 0           # pulse a held fire button at this rate; 0 = off
```

### Port devices

`port1` and `port2` name the controller device plugged into each game port.
Either port accepts any device, exactly as on real hardware:

- `mouse` -- a quadrature mouse. Its three buttons are the left (`/FIRx`),
  right (`POTxY`), and middle (`POTxX`) lines.
- `joystick` -- a digital switch joystick with a fire button and a second
  button on the `POTxY` line.
- `cd32` -- a CD32 joypad: a digital joystick plus the serial button
  protocol lowlevel.library reads (Red/Blue ride the fire/button-2 lines;
  Green, Yellow, Play, Rewind and Forward exist only serially).
- `analogue` -- analogue paddles or a proportional stick presenting
  resistances on the `POTxX`/`POTxY` pins, with the two paddle buttons on
  the left/right direction lines. No live host device maps to it yet:
  drive it with `--pot-after` scripting or the control protocol's
  `input.analogue` method (positions default to centre).
- `none` -- an empty port.

The defaults are today's stock wiring: a mouse in port 1 and a joystick in
port 2 -- a CD32 pad on the CD32 profile, whose bundled controller the
machine expects (an explicit key beats the profile; a real CD32 accepts any
controller too). `--port1` / `--port2` override for one run, the runtime
menu's **Port 1/2 Device** items hot-plug a device live, and the control
protocol's `input.set_port` does the same from a script.

Putting joysticks in *both* ports is a real two-player setup: the host
gamepad and the keyboard mapping then drive one port each (see below).

### Joystick input source

`joystick` selects the initial host source for the joystick/CD32-pad port.
There are two explicit modes, so the active source is always visible rather
than depending on whether a pad happens to be connected:

- `gamepad` (the default) -- only a physical pad drives the joystick port.
  The keyboard is left to the Amiga, so it passes straight through to a
  Shell, an editor, or Workbench, and no keys are unexpectedly captured as
  joystick input. With no pad connected there is simply no joystick input.
- `keyboard` -- use the keyboard-joystick mapping (cursor keys plus the fire
  keys), so the port stays usable without a controller.

With one joystick/CD32-pad port the mode picks its source. With two, both
sources are in play -- the gamepad and the cursor-key mapping drive one
port each -- and the mode picks which source gets the lower-numbered port;
whenever no physical pad is present, a second keyboard mapping on the
numeric keypad (`8`/`2`/`4`/`6` directions, `0` fire, `.` second button)
stands in for the gamepad, so two players can share one keyboard.

The keyboard mapping drives whatever device its port carries. In
particular, with mice in *both* ports the host mouse takes the
lower-numbered one and, in `keyboard` mode, the cursor-key mapping drives
the second as an emulated mouse: cursor keys move the pointer, the fire
keys are the left button, `X` the right, `D` the middle.

This only sets the starting mode. The status-bar toggle (the gamepad /
keyboard icon next to the volume control), `Cmd+J` / `Alt+J`, the menu's
**Joystick Input** item, and the launcher's *Input* tab all flip it live
without changing the config. `--joystick MODE` overrides this for a single
run. (`auto` is still accepted here as a backward-compatibility alias for
`gamepad`; the old auto-detect mode has been removed.)

`mouse_sensitivity` scales how fast the emulated pointer tracks the host
mouse, 0-100. `50` (the default, shown as *Default* in the GUI) is 1:1 --
exactly the previous behaviour -- `0` is a quarter speed and `100` quadruple,
on an exponential scale so each step is an even ratio. It is a host-input
scale applied to live mouse motion only: it never touches the emulated machine
or scripted `--mouse-after` input, so headless and recorded runs stay
deterministic. Set it from the launcher's *Input* tab or
`--mouse-sensitivity N`, and adjust it live with `Cmd+Shift+>` / `Cmd+Shift+<`
(`Alt+Shift+>` / `Alt+Shift+<` on Linux and Windows), which ramp while held.

### Mouse capture

Capturing the mouse confines the host pointer to the window and hides the
host cursor, so the Amiga pointer is the only one on screen. `mouse_capture`
decides when that grab is taken:

- `click` (the default) -- clicking the display grabs it. That click is a
  window action and is not passed to the Amiga, so the first click the guest
  sees is the first one aimed at it.
- `auto` -- grab as soon as the window has the focus, and again whenever it
  regains it, so no host cursor is ever loose over the display. Entering
  fullscreen grabs too. This suits a mouse-driven game or a fullscreen
  session where the host desktop is not wanted.
- `manual` -- only the shortcut grabs. Clicks on the display go straight to
  the Amiga and the host cursor is left alone.

`Cmd+G` / `Alt+G` releases and re-takes the grab by hand in every mode, and
an explicit release is never undone automatically. Opening a panel or tool
window borrows the cursor and hands the capture back when the last one
closes.

Uncaptured, host cursor motion over the display still drives the emulated
mouse in every mode; this setting only decides when the grab is taken, not
whether motion reaches the machine. Set it from the launcher's *Input* tab
or `--mouse-capture MODE`.

### Autofire

`autofire_hz` turns a *held* fire button into a pulse train at that many
presses per second; `0` (the default) leaves the button alone. It applies to
live input only -- the gamepad and the keyboard mapping -- and never to
scripted input (`--joy-after`, `--script`, the control protocol's
`input.joy`), which must replay exactly the events it was given.

The phase comes from emulated time, so the rate is the same under warp and
on PAL or NTSC. Nothing about the emulated machine changes: the port sees an
ordinary button being pressed and released on `/FIRx`. Only the fire button
is pulsed; directions and the second button pass through untouched.

`--autofire HZ` sets it for one run, and the menu's **Autofire** item cycles
off / 3 / 5 / 8 / 12 / 16 Hz live. The maximum is 30 Hz -- above that the
assert window is shorter than the frame the guest samples the port on.

### Remapping the keyboard controller

The keyboard-to-controller bindings are a host preference, not part of the
emulated machine, so they live beside the gamepad calibration rather than in
a machine config: the menu's **Input Mapping...** item edits them and Save
writes `keymap.toml` next to `gamepads.toml` (see
[Gamepad calibration](ui.md#gamepad-calibration) for the per-platform
location). Any control may take several keys -- fire ships with four aliases
so compact keyboards without the right-hand modifiers still work -- and
binding a key removes it from wherever it was before, including from the
other mapping, so the two controllers can never fight over one key. Deleting
the file restores the built-in layouts, as does the panel's **Defaults**
button.

## `[serial]` -- serial port and MIDI

```toml
[serial]
mode = "stdout"          # off, stdout, midi, tcp, tcp-connect, or pty
# midi_out = "FluidSynth"  # midi mode: host destination, substring match
# midi_in = "Keystation"   # midi mode: host source, substring match
# listen = "127.0.0.1:1234"  # tcp mode: bind address
# connect = "bbs.example.com:1337"  # tcp-connect mode: remote to dial
```

The Amiga serial port doubles as the MIDI port. `mode` selects where
Paula's serial in/out is connected:

- `stdout` (the default) -- serial output prints to the host terminal,
  matching the historical behaviour (DiagROM and similar tools log here).
- `off` -- serial output is discarded and there is no serial input.
- `midi` -- serial in/out is bridged to host MIDI endpoints. Needs a build
  with the `midi` feature (the default); `midi_out`/`midi_in` name the
  endpoints by case-insensitive substring (a USB interface or a virtual
  port). `--list-midi` prints the host endpoints.
- `tcp` -- serial in/out is bridged to a host TCP port, like UAE's `TCP:`
  device. `listen` sets the bind address (default `127.0.0.1:1234`);
  connect with e.g. `nc`, `socat`, or a raw-mode telnet client.
- `tcp-connect` -- the outbound counterpart of `tcp`: at startup the
  serial port dials the remote named by `connect` (required, `host:port`)
  and the session talks to that service. Point a guest terminal program
  at a telnet BBS, a `tcpser` modem bridge, or any TCP byte service. The
  connection is made once; if the remote hangs up, output drops like an
  unplugged cable until the next run. Note that the wire carries raw
  bytes: for telnet servers that insist on option negotiation, put a
  telnet-aware relay in between, or pick a BBS/port that accepts raw
  connections (most do).
- `pty` -- serial in/out is bridged to a host pseudo-terminal (Unix only).
  The slave path (`/dev/pts/N`) is logged at startup; attach a terminal
  with e.g. `minicom -D`, `screen`, or `cu -l`.

With an `AUX:` shell on the Amiga side, `tcp`/`pty` give a remote AmigaDOS
console. `--serial MODE` overrides the mode per run,
`--serial-connect HOST:PORT` sets the dial-out target (and implies
`mode = "tcp-connect"`), and `--midi-out NAME`/`--midi-in NAME` imply
`mode = "midi"`. The launcher's **I/O Ports** tab (Serial section) and the
in-window **MIDI In / MIDI Out** menu items select the MIDI endpoints
interactively.

The browser build has its own serial transport (the page bridges the port
to a WebSocket); see [the browser chapter](browser.md).

## `[parallel]` -- Centronics parallel port

```toml
[parallel]
device = "printer"           # none | printer | sampler
output = "printer.raw"       # printer capture path
# device = "sampler"
# sampler_input = "MacBook Air Microphone"  # host input; omit for the default
# sampler_gain = 6.0                          # preamp gain in dB (0 = unity)
```

`device` chooses the peripheral on the parallel port (one at a time). Without
this section the connector is electrically disconnected: CIA-A still produces
its hardware `PC` strobe on port-B accesses (`$BFE101`), but no peripheral
acknowledges it and port-B reads see the CIA's own pins. The equivalent per-run
flags are `--parallel DEVICE`, `--sampler-audio-input NAME`, and
`--sampler-input-gain X`; `--sampler-list-audio-inputs` prints the input-device
names and exits.

`"printer"` attaches a raw Centronics sink at `output` (a bare `output` with no
`device` still selects the printer, for compatibility). The file is created at
startup, replacing any existing file; each strobed byte is written verbatim and
returns the printer `/ACK` falling edge through CIA-A `FLAG`, including the
normal CIA interrupt delay. The printer also drives the Centronics status
lines on CIA-B port A -- SEL high, BUSY and POUT low -- so the guest's
`parallel.device` sees a ready online printer and starts sending. (Without an
attached device those lines float high, and printing waits forever for a
printer to appear, as on a real machine.) It is intentionally not decoded, since the guest may
emit any printer language; pass it to a converter or spooler afterwards.

`"sampler"` attaches an 8-bit audio sampler (digitizer) on the data lines -- the
emulated equivalent of a classic parallel-port sampler cartridge, driving
software such as AudioMaster, ProTracker, OctaMED, and TurboSound. It captures
from a host input device (cpal, like live audio output, so it needs a build with
the `frontend` feature) and presents each read of the data lines as an 8-bit
offset-binary sample in emulated time, mono (host left/right are summed).
`sampler_input` names the host device (case-insensitive substring, as
`--sampler-list-audio-inputs` prints; omitted uses the system default);
`sampler_gain` is the preamp gain in decibels (0 dB = unity) applied before the
ADC, clamped to the sampler's range (roughly -24 to +24 dB). The input device
and gain can also be changed live
from the runtime menu, and the gain with `Cmd/Alt+Shift +/-`. On macOS the CLI
binary needs microphone permission to capture a real input; routing audio in
through a loopback device such as BlackHole needs none.

## `[floppy]` and `[floppy.df0]` .. `[floppy.df3]`

```toml
[floppy]
drives = 2                 # DF0 and DF1 connected; default is DF0 only
speed = 100                # 100/200/400/800 percent, or 0 for turbo

[floppy.df0]
path = "demo.adf"            # single image, or:
# paths = ["disk1.adf", "disk2.adf"]   # swap playlist (shortcut cycles)
write_protected = true       # default true
# enabled = true             # implied by path/paths
```

`drives` controls how many mechanisms are wired, from one to four. DF0 is
the internal drive; DF1-DF3 are external drives that answer the standard
Amiga external-drive ID protocol when connected. A configured disk image
also connects that drive automatically, so existing configs that name
`[floppy.df1]` .. `[floppy.df3]` keep working.

`speed` accelerates the emulated drives beyond the authentic data rate.
`100` (the default) is real speed. `200`, `400`, and `800` clock the whole
data path -- platter rotation, the MFM read shifter, sync detection,
DSKBYTR, and DMA pacing -- at that multiple, so everything software can
observe stays bit-identical to real speed, only compressed in time. `0`
selects turbo: a started disk DMA transfer completes almost instantly
(deferred by two scanlines, matching other emulators' turbo modes, so
loaders that clear stale interrupt flags right after starting a transfer
still see the completion). Drive mechanics are never accelerated: motor
spin-up, head stepping, and post-seek settle always run at real time.
Faster-than-real speeds are a compatibility trade-off, exactly as in other
emulators: the operating system and most loaders tolerate them, but
software that times its own loading against the beam, CIA timers, or music
playback can break. The setting can be changed live from the runtime menu
("Floppy Speed") without restarting the machine.

Supported image formats: standard 901120-byte DD ADF, gzip-compressed
images (ADZ), single file ZIP archives, DMS archives, UAE extended ADF, and
read-only SCP flux images. DMS, gzip, and SCP images are decoded at load time
and always treated as write-protected; set `write_protected = false` on a plain
ADF to allow write-through updates to the image file.

The loader deliberately rejects IPF/CAPS images. Useful support would require
either a direct IPF parser or an optional SPS/CAPS library, with its licensing,
platform packaging, and dynamic-loading strategy settled before it becomes a
dependency. The browser frontend shares this decoder, so it rejects IPF too.

A `paths` playlist lets multi-disk software that only drives DF0: run
without a second drive: the first entry is the boot disk and the disk-swap
shortcut (`Cmd+D` on macOS, `Alt+D` on Linux/Windows) or the status-bar
swap button cycles to the next image, wrapping around.

## `[ide]` -- IDE hard disks

```toml
[machine]
profile = "A600"             # IDE needs a machine with an IDE port
                             # (A600 or A1200 Gayle, or the A4000)

[ide]
master = "AmigaSYS.hdf"      # raw flat HDF, read/write
# slave = "scratch.hdf"
```

Images are opened read/write. Both kinds of HDF work directly:

- a full disk image with its own Rigid Disk Block (RDSK/PART chain), and
- a bare partition hardfile (boot block starts with `DOS\x..`), which is
  wrapped in a synthesized RDB on the fly: one extra cylinder of
  16-surface x 32-sector geometry holding an RDSK and a bootable `DH0`
  PART block, with the image's own dostype. The image must be a multiple
  of 256 KiB so the partition is an exact cylinder count. Writes to the
  partition go back to the image file; writes to the synthesized RDB area
  (re-partitioning) live only for the session.

A path may also name a **host directory**: its tree is built into an
in-memory FFS volume at startup (volume name = directory name, files and
subdirectories included; entries whose names cannot exist on an Amiga
volume are skipped with a warning). The guest sees an ordinary bootable
FFS disk and may write to it, but the volume lives only in memory --
nothing is written back to the host directory, and changes are lost at
exit. Note that the stock A1200/A600 Kickstart `scsi.device` only probes
the IDE master; a slave drive needs a guest OS or driver that supports
two units (e.g. Kickstart 3.1.4).

To override the volume name (instead of inheriting the directory name) or
the boot priority, give the drive as a table with `path` plus `name`
and/or `bootpri`:

```toml
[ide]
master = { path = "/host/Games", name = "Games" }
slave = { path = "wb.hdf", bootpri = 6 }
# slave = "scratch.hdf"        # the bare-string form still works
```

The name sets the FFS volume label of a directory mount; AmigaDOS volume
names hold up to 30 characters and cannot contain `:` or `/`. It has no
effect on a raw HDF, which carries its own label inside the image.

`bootpri` (-128..127, default 0) is the `de_BootPri` written into the
**synthesized** RDB's partition, which is what the ROM's strap ranks boot
candidates by. Kickstart enters DF0: at priority 5, so the default 0 loses
the tie to a bootable floppy; raise it to 6 to boot the hard disk ahead of
one, or lower it to sort two hardfiles against each other. The sentinel
-128 also clears the partition's `PBFB_BOOTABLE` flag, so the volume
mounts but is never offered for boot. It has **no effect on an image that
carries its own RDB** -- those priorities live inside the image, where
HDToolBox put them -- and Copperline logs a warning if you set it on one.

The configuration screen edits `bootpri` on the *Storage* tab's **Boot
Priority** sub-page, one row per drive (see [](ui.md)): a Priority number and a
Bootable box, the cleared box being this -128 sentinel. A drive left at 0 with
no cascade default writes no `bootpri` key.

The drive responds to ATA IDENTIFY with the Gayle byte order real hardware
uses, so both Kickstart 3.1 variants boot from it. An HDD activity LED
appears in the status bar on IDE machines. On the `A4000` profile the same
`[ide]` section attaches drives to the motherboard IDE interface at
`$DD2020` (no Gayle involved; Kickstart's `scsi.device` drives it the same
way).

CD images (`.cue`/`.iso`) are rejected here: the emulated IDE port speaks
plain ATA, not ATAPI. Attach CD-ROM drives as `[scsi]` units instead (see
below).

## `[scsi]` -- SCSI controllers

```toml
[scsi]
# controller = "a2091"       # a2091 (default), a4091, or a3000
rom = "a2091-v6.6.rom"       # boot ROM image (a2091/a4091; the a3000 needs none)
# rom_odd = "a2091-odd.rom"  # a2091 only: split even/odd EPROM dumps
unit0 = "workbench.hdf"      # SCSI IDs 0-6
unit1 = "data.hdf"
unit2 = "game.cue"           # a .cue or .iso attaches a CD-ROM drive
# unit3..unit6 = ...
```

The `[scsi]` section attaches a SCSI host adapter with up to **seven
drives**. `controller` picks which one:

- `"a2091"` (the default on machines without onboard SCSI): a Commodore
  A2091 (Commodore DMAC + WD33C93A) as a Zorro II autoconfig board. It
  works on **any machine model** (the board needs no Gayle) and has no
  dependence on the Kickstart IDE driver -- the board's own boot ROM
  carries `scsi.device` and autoboots on Kickstart 1.3 and newer, which
  also sidesteps the stock A600/A1200 `scsi.device` only probing the IDE
  master. `[ide]` remains available, and both can be used at once.
- `"a4091"`: a Commodore A4091 (NCR 53C710 SCSI-2) as a Zorro III
  autoconfig board, for machines with a 32-bit CPU. It needs a raw A4091
  EPROM image (e.g. the open-source `a4091.rom`) as `rom`; it has a single
  ROM, so `rom_odd` does not apply.
- `"a3000"` (the default on the `A3000` profile): the A3000's motherboard
  SCSI -- the Super DMAC at `$DD0000` driving a WD33C93. It is silicon, not
  a card, so it needs no boot ROM: Kickstart's own `scsi.device` drives it
  and autoboots from an RDB drive. It is only valid on a machine with the
  Super DMAC (the A3000).

For the A2091, `rom` must point at an A590/A2091 boot ROM image (version
6.6 or later; 16K/32K, available from the same vendors and dump sets as
Kickstart ROMs). Dumps split into even/odd EPROM halves can be given as
`rom` (even, U13) plus `rom_odd` (odd, U12). The ROM is required on the
Zorro boards because the autoboot DiagArea and the scsi.device driver
itself live in it; the autoconfig identity comes from the board (the
A2091 is Commodore product 3, with its DiagArea vector at `$2000`).

Each `unitN` accepts everything `[ide]` paths do: RDB images, bare
partition hardfiles (a synthesized RDB advertises a bootable `DHn`
partition, named after the SCSI ID), and host directories built into
in-memory FFS volumes -- including the
`{ path = "...", name = "...", bootpri = N }` table form that overrides a
directory mount's volume name and the synthesized partition's boot
priority. The HDD activity LED covers SCSI traffic too.

A `unitN` path ending in `.cue` or `.iso` attaches a **SCSI CD-ROM
drive** at that ID instead of a hard disk: a read-only removable SCSI-2
target (INQUIRY device type 5) serving 2048-byte blocks, with the full
READ TOC / READ CD / mode-page surface CD filesystems expect. Cue/bin
images may mix data and audio tracks; a bare `.iso` is a single data
track. The drive answers on the host adapter's `scsi.device` like any
other unit, so mount it the way you would on real hardware: a
`DOSDrivers` mount entry (or MountList) pointing `CDFileSystem` --
CacheCDFS, AsimCDFS, and AmiCDROM work the same way -- at the controller's
`scsi.device` and the drive's unit number.

CD audio plays: the PLAY AUDIO command group streams the disc's audio
tracks into the machine's audio output at 75 sectors per second of
emulated time (as if the drive's analogue output were cabled to the
machine), the sub-channel reports the live playback position, and the
debugger's Audio tab shows the stream on its CD-DA row with the play
state, track, and position. Discs swap at runtime like CDTV/CD32 media:
the status bar's CD load/eject buttons, dropping a `.cue`/`.iso` on the
window, the scheduled `--insert-cd-after SECS PATH` flag, or the control
protocol's `media.cd.insert` all eject the current disc, run the tray
for a second of emulated time, and mount the new one with a
medium-change unit attention for the guest's filesystem to notice.

## `[[filesys]]` -- host directories as live volumes

```toml
[[filesys]]
path = "/data/amiga/Workbench"
volume = "Workbench"   # optional, defaults to the directory name
bootpri = 6            # optional boot priority; default -128 = never boot

[[filesys]]
path = "/data/amiga/downloads"
readonly = true        # optional, export the directory write-protected
```

Each `[[filesys]]` entry exports a host directory to the guest as an
AmigaDOS volume on its own `HOSTFS<n>:` device, served live by the
emulator: no disk image is built, and guest reads always see the current
host contents. This differs from giving `[ide]`/`[scsi]` a directory
path, which snapshots the tree into an in-memory FFS volume at startup.
Up to 8 mounts.

The volumes are read-write by default: the guest creates, writes, renames,
and deletes the host's files directly, and changes land in the directory
as you would expect. Set `readonly = true` to export a directory
write-protected instead -- the guest sees a read-only disk and every write
fails with the same "disk is write-protected" error a physical
write-protected disk gives, which is worth setting on anything you would
rather the Amiga could not damage. The launcher's Host Mounts sub-page (under
the Storage tab) exposes the same choice as its **Access** field.

Amiga file attributes a host filesystem cannot hold -- protection bits
such as script/pure/archive, file comments, and exact datestamps -- are
kept in UAE-style `.uaem` sidecar files, read when present and written
back when the guest changes them; the sidecars stay hidden from guest
listings, and the delete-protection bit is honoured. Host filenames are
mapped between UTF-8 and the guest's Latin-1 (names with no Latin-1
spelling are hidden, since the guest could neither display nor reopen
them). Host symlinks inside the mount are followed, wherever they point:
the guest has no way to create one, so a symlink is treated as the host
user deliberately grafting a directory into the mount, the same trust
model as the UAE family.

`volume` sets the AmigaDOS volume name (up to 30 characters, no `:` or
`/`). `bootpri` enters the volume in the boot-device vote (-128..127;
the default -128 means mounted but never booted from): hard-disk boot
partitions typically sit at priority 0 and DF0: at 5, so a bootable
Workbench directory with `bootpri = 6` boots ahead of both.

## `[cd]` -- CDTV and CD32

```toml
[machine]
profile = "CD32"

[cd]
image = "disc.cue"        # BIN/CUE cue sheet (MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352, AUDIO)
insert_delay = 0.0        # emulated seconds after power-on to insert
# nvram = "cd32-nvram.bin" # CD32 save-game EEPROM backing file (default)
```

The disc mounts on the machine's CD controller: Akiko on CD32, the DMAC on
CDTV. `insert_delay` inserts the disc some emulated seconds after power-on
with the proper media-change notification; some CDTV discs only boot when
inserted after the boot screen appears. CD32 NVRAM
persists to `cd32-nvram.bin` next to the working directory unless
overridden; without a path the EEPROM is session-only.

## `[[zorro]]` -- expansion boards

```toml
[[zorro]]
metadata = "boards/megaram.toml"

[[zorro]]
metadata = "boards/myboard.toml"
# config = { mode = "fast" }  # WASM plugin boards: setting overrides
```

Each entry adds a Zorro board described by a TOML metadata file, configured
in file order after the built-in `[memory]` fast/z3 boards. For a WASM
plugin board, the optional `config` table overrides individual settings
that the plugin's manifest declares (layered over the manifest's `[config]`
defaults; the launcher's Zorro tab edits the same values). See
[](../zorro) for the metadata format, the plugin ABI, and how autoconfig
assigns addresses.

## `[a2065]` -- Ethernet

```toml
[a2065]
net = "nat"   # or "bridge", "loopback"; "none" for an isolated NIC
# interface = "en0"  # required for "bridge"
```

Fits a Commodore A2065 Ethernet board (Am7990 LANCE) on the Zorro chain;
`--a2065-net BACKEND` is the matching per-run flag, and the launcher's
**I/O Ports** tab (Ethernet section) has the same picker. `net` selects the
host network backend:

- `"nat"` -- userspace NAT: the guest gets outbound IPv4 internet through a
  virtual gateway with no host privileges or setup, identically on Linux,
  macOS, and Windows. Configure the guest's TCP/IP stack with IP
  `10.0.2.15`, netmask `255.255.255.0`, gateway `10.0.2.2`, DNS `10.0.2.3`
  (or let it BOOTP/DHCP). Outbound only, IPv4 only.
- `"bridge"` -- attaches complete Ethernet frames directly to `interface`, so
  the Amiga is a separate station on the physical LAN and can accept inbound
  connections from LAN peers. Use `copperline --list-net-interfaces` for exact
  identifiers, or `--a2065-interface NAME` (which implies the bridge backend).
  Configure the guest by DHCP from the real LAN or with an address appropriate
  to that LAN. The guest can reach peers and the router; communication with the
  host's own IP is adapter/OS-dependent and is not guaranteed. Frames keep the
  Amiga's source MAC, so Wi-Fi is best-effort: many access points reject a
  second source MAC behind one wireless station. Copperline reports adapter,
  driver, and permission failures at startup instead of falling back to NAT.
- `"loopback"` -- echoes transmitted frames back (self-contained, useful
  for driver bring-up).
- `"none"` -- the NIC is fitted but isolated.

Omit the section entirely for no board. Note that host networking is
inherently non-deterministic: inbound frames arrive on the host's
schedule, not the emulated clock, so a NIC board breaks byte-identical
replay and save-state determinism while traffic flows. A save state stores the
bridge adapter identifier and must be restored on a host where that adapter can
be opened. See [](../zorro) for board details, platform bridge setup, and the
NAT's limitations.

## `[rtg]` -- RTG graphics card

```toml
[rtg]
card = "z3660"
```

`card` is `"z3660"` or `"none"`; a machine takes at most one. The Z3660 is a
Zorro III board, so it comes fitted by default on machines whose CPU has a
32-bit address bus (the A3000 and A4000) and is unavailable on the rest --
asking for it there is an error, as it is for Zorro III RAM. It gives the
guest high-resolution,
high-colour screens through Picasso96. It needs the
open-source Z3660.card driver installed in the guest (with its monitor in
`DEVS:Monitors`); with that in place, Z3660 screen modes appear in
ScreenMode, and the window shows the board's output when a screen is
opened, switching back to the native Amiga display when it closes.

The board's stock monitor ships with the `DISPLAYCHAIN=NO` tooltype, which
models the real hardware's separate RTG monitor and never hands the display
back to the native screen. On a single-window emulator you usually want
`DISPLAYCHAIN=YES`, so the one window follows whichever screen is active.

## `[debug]` -- diagnostics

```toml
[debug]
log_unmapped = "DD0000-DEFFFF"
validate_chipset = true
detect_smc = true
```

`log_unmapped` logs every CPU read and write inside the given range that no
device decodes. Reads report the floating bus value they returned, writes
report the value that went nowhere. The value is a hex `START-END` range whose
end is included (a leading `0x` is allowed), or `all` for the whole address
space.

This is how you find the registers a guest expects and Copperline does not
implement yet. A missing register is usually invisible: a read floats, a write
is dropped, and the guest either sulks or hangs with no diagnostic. Pointing
this at the window a driver probes shows the access pattern directly -- an IDE
presence probe, say, appears as a write of `$A0` to the device/head register
followed by a long run of status reads that never come back ready.

A booting Kickstart probes enough empty address space that `all` produces on
the order of a million lines per boot, so prefer a range once you know roughly
where to look.

`validate_chipset` arms the custom-register access validator: a running
report of software using the chipset in ways the hardware quietly ignores.
It flags writes to registers the fitted Agnus/Denise does not have, bits a
register does not define, writes to read-only registers and reads of
write-only ones, byte or odd-address access to word registers, access
through an address mirror, and DMA pointers aimed past the chip RAM Agnus
can address. It also covers the engines behind those registers, where
misuse hangs rather than glitches: a blit started while the previous one
is still running (there is no register-file interlock, so the running
blit is drained and the replacement starts from whatever pointer state it
left) or with its DMA switched off (BBUSY is set and the blit stays
pending until BLTEN and DMAEN are enabled), disk DMA armed against a
drive that could not serve it at that moment -- no media, or the motor
still off, the class behind the classic loader dead-spins -- and a
keyboard handshake pulse too narrow to count as one while the MCU was
waiting for it, which costs a key and stalls input until the keyboard
resynchronises after 143 ms. Each finding names the PC (or Copper address) that made the
access and the beam position, is deduplicated by (kind, register, writer)
with a repeat count, and is logged the first time it is seen. It also arms
a per-register last-writer table, which answers "what set BPLCON3, and
from where?" without a bisect. Read both over the control protocol with
`chipset.report` and `custom.writer` (see
[the control protocol](../debugger/control.md)), which can also arm and
disarm the validator live. Off by default; an unarmed machine pays nothing
for it.

`detect_smc` reports writes that land on memory the CPU has already
executed. Self-modification is legitimate on a 68000 -- decrunchers,
trackers and Copper-list patchers all do it -- but it is also where a
prefetch-related bug hides, since the CPU has already fetched the word
ahead of the one it is executing, and neither a patch applied too late
nor one applied to the wrong address leaves a trace at the moment it
happens. Each report names the written address, the instruction that
wrote it, and the distance between them, calling out a patch close enough
to sit inside the prefetch. An address counts as code once an instruction
there has retired, so an instruction patching its own extension words on
its only execution is not reported; every repeating pattern is caught on
the pass after the first. Read it with `smc.report` over the control
