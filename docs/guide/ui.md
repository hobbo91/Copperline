# The window, status bar, and menus

Copperline opens a single window: the emulated display presented at a
TV-like 4:3 aspect ratio, above a status bar with the machine's controls.
The window scales continuously when resized.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The app shortcut modifier is `Cmd` on macOS and `Alt` on Linux/Windows.

| macOS | Linux/Windows | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `Cmd+Q` | `Alt+Q` | Quit |
| `Cmd+S` | `Alt+S` | Save a screenshot (`copperline-screenshot-<YYYYMMDDHHmmSS>.png` in the working directory; the on-screen confirmation overlay is not part of the saved image) |
| `Cmd+R` | `Alt+R` | Start / stop a video-with-audio recording (below) |
| `Cmd+Shift+R` | `Alt+Shift+R` | Start / stop an input recording (below) |
| `Cmd+Shift+S` | `Alt+Shift+S` | Save a state (`copperline-state-<YYYYMMDDHHmmSS>.clstate` in the working directory) |
| `Cmd+Shift+L` | `Alt+Shift+L` | Load a save state from a file dialog |
| `Cmd+1`..`Cmd+9`, `Cmd+0` | `Alt+1`..`Alt+9`, `Alt+0` | Quick-save to numbered slot 1-10 |
| `Cmd+Shift+1`..`Cmd+Shift+0` | `Alt+Shift+1`..`Alt+Shift+0` | Quick-load from that slot |
| `Cmd+D` | `Alt+D` | Swap to the next disk in a drive's configured playlist |
| `Cmd+G` | `Alt+G` | Capture / release the host mouse (clicking the display also captures) |
| `Cmd+B` | `Alt+B` | Open the [debugger window](../debugger/window) |
| `Cmd+K` | `Alt+K` | Open the [debugger console](../debugger/console) |
| `Cmd+J` | `Alt+J` | Toggle joystick input mode: gamepad / keyboard (also the status-bar icon) |
| `Cmd+M` | `Alt+M` | Toggle the 1084-style monitor bezel around the picture (`[display] bezel` sets the start-up value) |
| `Cmd+Shift+A` | `Alt+Shift+A` | Cycle the audio output: Default, each host device, then Disabled (also the menu's Audio Out item) |
| `Cmd+A` | `Alt+A` | Cycle Paula's audio filter: auto, on, off (also the menu's Audio Filter item) |
| `Cmd+Shift++` / `Cmd+Shift+-` | `Alt+Shift++` / `Alt+Shift+-` | Raise / lower the parallel-port sampler input gain (only when a sampler is attached; also the menu's Sampler Gain item) |
| `Cmd+Shift+>` / `Cmd+Shift+<` | `Alt+Shift+>` / `Alt+Shift+<` | Raise / lower the host mouse sensitivity (also the launcher's Input tab) |
| `Cmd+F` | `Alt+F` | Toggle fullscreen on / off |
| `Cmd+Shift+F` | `Alt+Shift+F` | Show / hide the status bar |
| `Cmd+W` | `Alt+W` | Toggle Warp Speed (turbo) on / off |
| `Cmd+Shift+W` | `Alt+Shift+W` | Cycle the Warp Speed limit: 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, Max |
| `Cmd+Z` | `Alt+Z` | Rewind the machine one step (needs `[emulation] rewind` or the Rewind menu item) |
| `Esc` | `Esc` | Close an open menu, tool window, or overlay panel; otherwise passed through to the Amiga |
| `Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga` | `Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga` | Keyboard reset (warm reboot) |

Host modifiers that are passed through to the emulated keyboard map onto
the Amiga keyboard: Alt becomes Amiga Alt, Cmd/Super becomes the left/right
Amiga keys, and left Ctrl becomes Amiga Ctrl, so `Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga` is
typed naturally. The Amiga keyboard has no right Ctrl, so host right Ctrl
also acts as the right Amiga key -- handy on PC/laptop keyboards that lack
a right Super/Win key.

All other keys are sent to the emulated machine through the real path: a
bit-timed keyboard-MCU model clocks each transition into CIA-A's serial
register over the emulated KCLK/KDAT lines, with the real handshake,
power-up stream, and recovery protocol -- so even software that talks to
the keyboard hardware directly behaves. `Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga` runs the
authentic reset protocol (reset warning, then KCLK held low), so the
reboot lands a fraction of a second after the chord, as on real hardware.

## Status bar

The status bar (44 pixels below the display) holds, left to right (it can
be hidden entirely with `Cmd+Shift+F` / `Alt+Shift+F` or the **Status Bar**
menu item):

- **LED block.** PWR and FDD always; a green HDD activity LED on machines
  with a hard-disk controller (Gayle or A4000 IDE, or any SCSI adapter) or a
  host-folder filesystem mount (`[[filesys]]`), lit while either is accessed; a
  blue CD activity LED on CDTV/CD32 that lights while the drive reads data
  or plays CD audio (on a machine whose CD drive is a SCSI CD-ROM unit,
  the LED shows CD-DA playback; its data reads ride the HDD LED with the
  rest of the SCSI bus). A small digital counter shows the current floppy
  track. The PWR LED is lit whenever the machine is powered, driven by the
  guest's /LED line the way it drives the LED on an A500 rev 6 or later
  board: full brightness while the line is engaged (Paula's analogue
  filter on), dimmed -- not extinguished -- once the software releases it.
  It follows the pin itself, so the **Audio Filter** menu override changes
  what you hear, never the LED.
- **Per-drive floppy controls.** Every connected drive gets a disk button
  (marked with the drive number) that opens a file dialog -- multi-select
  several images to queue a swap playlist for that drive -- plus a swap
  button that cycles to the next queued disk and an eject button. Swap and
  eject grey out when there is nothing to swap to or eject. With three or
  four drives the clusters stack two-up.
- **CD controls** on machines with a CD drive (CDTV, CD32, or a SCSI
  CD-ROM unit): a CD button that loads (or swaps) a CD image
  (`.cue`/`.iso`) with the proper media-change notification, and a CD
  eject button. These do not appear on machines without a CD drive.
- **Joystick toggle** (just left of the volume control): a gamepad or
  keyboard icon showing which source drives the joystick port. Click it to
  flip between gamepad-only and keyboard joystick emulation; see
  [](#controller-ports).
- **Volume slider**: drag, or scroll the mouse wheel over it for 5% steps.
- **Hamburger menu button**: opens the pop-up menu (below).
- **Camera button**: saves a screenshot (same as `Cmd+S` on macOS or
  `Alt+S` on Linux/Windows).
- **Pause / power / reboot buttons.** Pause freezes emulation while staying
  powered; power cold-boots (clears RAM) or powers off back to the test
  screen; reboot is a warm reset.

## Drag and drop

Disk images can be dropped anywhere on the emulator window:

- **Floppy images** (ADF/ADZ/DMS/SCP, gzip or zip packed): with one
  connected drive the disk is inserted immediately. With several, a drive
  chooser opens over the display -- click a drive, press its number
  (`1`-`4`), or press `Esc` to cancel. Dropping several floppies at once
  queues them all as the target drive's swap playlist, exactly like a
  multi-selection in the disk dialog.
- **CD images** (`.cue`/`.iso`) mount in the machine's CD drive (CDTV,
  CD32, or a SCSI CD-ROM unit), with the media-change notification.
- **Hard disk images and Kickstart ROMs** cannot be swapped at runtime; a
  notice points at the machine-configuration screen, which also refuses
  drops while it is open.

The chooser opens after the drop rather than offering per-drive drop
targets because the windowing layer reports file drops without a cursor
position. For the same reason drops are unavailable under native Wayland
(X11/XWayland works).

## Menu, tool windows, and overlay panels

```{figure} ../images/ui-preview-menu.png
:alt: The pop-up menu
:width: 75%

The pop-up menu opened from the status bar.
```

The menu opens debugger-style tool windows and smaller overlay panels. It
grows upward from the status bar, and adapts when the list is long (the MIDI
and sampler items only appear in some sessions): the rows tighten first, and
past that the list scrolls, showing `^ more ^` / `v more v` rows at the ends.
Scroll with the mouse wheel over the menu or by clicking those rows; neither
dismisses the menu, and it always reopens at the top.

Tool windows are separate native windows so the emulated display remains visible;
the debugger and frame analyzer can be open at the same time. Overlay panels
are drawn over the display. While either kind is open, key presses and display
clicks stay in the UI instead of reaching the Amiga; `Esc` closes the focused
tool window or overlay.

- **Machine Configuration...**: opens the configuration screen
  ([below](#machine-configuration-screen)) to reconfigure the machine and
  relaunch it. The same screen opens automatically on a no-machine start.
- **Frame Analyzer...**: pauses the machine and opens a separate diagnostic
  window with two tabs: which chip-bus owner had each Agnus colour clock
  across the captured frame, including overscan and blanking, and a memory
  heat map of what last touched each part of the address space; see
  [](../debugger/window.md#frame-analyzer-pane).
- **Debugger...** (also `Cmd+B` on macOS or `Alt+B` on Linux/Windows):
  pauses the machine and opens the tabbed debugger in a tool window; see
  [](../debugger/window).
- **Console...** (also `Cmd+K` / `Alt+K`): a GDB-flavoured debugger
  command line in its own tool window; see [](../debugger/console).
- **Audio Out** (also `Cmd+Shift+A` / `Alt+Shift+A`): cycles the audio
  output through the system default, each host output device, and
  **Disabled** (sound off entirely, equivalent to `--noaudio`). The
  device switches live without a restart.
- **Audio Filter** (also `Cmd+A` / `Alt+A`): cycles Paula's analogue
  low-pass filter through **auto** (guest-driven, the default), **on**, and
  **off**. `on`/`off` force it regardless of what the software asks; `auto`
  restores hardware behaviour. The PWR LED keeps following the guest's
  /LED line whatever is forced here.
- **Calibrate Gamepad...**: the guided calibration flow, described below.
- **Joystick Input** (also `Cmd+J` / `Alt+J`, or the status-bar icon):
  toggles between gamepad-only and keyboard joystick emulation.
- **Port 1 Device / Port 2 Device**: hot-plug the controller in a game
  port, cycling mouse, joystick, CD32 pad, analogue, and empty; see
  [](#controller-ports).
- **Autofire**: cycles the autofire rate (off, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16 Hz), which
  pulses a *held* fire button on live gamepad and keyboard input. Scripted
  input is never gated; see the `[input]` section of
  [Configuration](configuration.md).
- **Input Mapping...**: edits which host keys drive the controller controls,
  for both keyboard mappings; see [](#input-mapping).
- **MIDI In / MIDI Out** (shown when the serial port is in MIDI mode):
  cycle Paula's serial bridge through the host's MIDI sources and
  destinations; see the `[serial]` section of
  [Configuration](configuration.md).
- **Sampler In / Sampler Gain** (shown when a parallel-port sampler is
  attached): cycle the sampler's host capture device, and step its input
  gain (also `Cmd/Alt+Shift +/-`). Both change live. See the `[parallel]`
  section of [Configuration](configuration.md).
- **Pixel Aspect**: flips the presentation between the 4:3 CRT pixel
  aspect (the default; PAL lo-res pixels slightly wider than tall, as a
  real TV shows them) and square pixels (a 320x256 screen is an exact
  640x512, handy for pixel-exact comparison with square-pixel emulators).
  The window and its backing texture resize with the mode. The start-up
  mode comes from `[display] pixel_aspect`
  (see [Configuration](configuration.md)).
- **CRT Shader**: cycles the GPU tube-emulation pass over the picture --
  **off**, **scanlines** (the line structure of a 15 kHz set), **mask** (an
  RGB phosphor shadow mask), **crt** (both, plus a bowed tube face and a
  corner vignette), and **custom** when the config named a shader of your
  own, which is re-read from disk each time it comes round. The change is
  session-only: the start-up preset, the strength knob, and how to write a
  custom shader are `[display] shader` and `shader_strength` (see
  [Configuration](configuration.md)). The pass is a window effect only --
  screenshots, frame dumps and recordings are never shader-processed -- and
  it steps aside for the frames it cannot sensibly draw: while this menu or
  any panel is open, under RTG, and in programmable multisync scan modes.
- **Screen Tint**: cycles the monochrome-monitor tint over the picture --
  **off** (full colour), **bw**, **green** and **amber** (the two classic
  monochrome phosphors), and **sepia** -- the same looks as the web
  frontend's *Screen* selector. Session-only, like the shader; the
  start-up tint is `[display] tint` (see
  [Configuration](configuration.md)). A window effect only: captures stay
  untinted, this menu and the status bar keep their colours, and RTG
  scanout is never tinted.
- **Floppy Speed**: cycles the emulated drive speed through 100% (real
  speed), 200%, 400%, 800%, and turbo (disk DMA transfers complete almost
  instantly). Changes apply to the live machine immediately. The start-up
  value comes from `[floppy] speed`; see
  [Configuration](configuration.md) for what each level preserves and the
  compatibility trade-off.
- **Fullscreen** (also `Cmd+F` / `Alt+F`): borderless fullscreen on the
  window's current monitor. The picture keeps its aspect and letterboxes
  as needed, exactly as when resizing the window; the same shortcut (or
  menu item) restores the window.
- **Status Bar** (also `Cmd+Shift+F` / `Alt+Shift+F`): show or hide the
  status bar. Handy alongside fullscreen for a clean, chrome-free picture;
  the same shortcut or menu item brings it back.
- **Warp Speed** (also `Cmd+W` / `Alt+W`): runs the emulator unpaced for
  fast-forward. Toggling back re-anchors real-time pacing cleanly.
- **Warp Limit** (also `Cmd+Shift+W` / `Alt+Shift+W`): cycles how fast warp
  runs. Because the window presents with vsync, emulating one frame per
  presented frame would cap warp at the host monitor's refresh rate (about
  1.2x for 50 Hz PAL on a 60 Hz display). The limit sets an output frame
  skip -- 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, or **Max** -- so warp retires that many emulated
  frames per presented frame, making the effective speed roughly the limit
  times the refresh rate (host CPU permitting). `Max` runs flat out and
  still presents at vsync. The default is set by `[emulation] warp_speed`
  (see [Configuration](configuration.md)).
- **Rewind** (the hotkey is `Cmd+Z` / `Alt+Z`): toggles recording of rewind
  history. While it is on, the emulator keeps a ring of whole-machine
  snapshots and the hotkey steps the machine back through them -- the whole
  machine, not just the picture: CPU, chips, RAM and all. One press goes back
  one capture interval (half a second of emulated time by default). Turning
  the item off releases the snapshots, which is where the memory goes; the
  budget and interval are `[emulation] rewind_budget_mb` and
  `rewind_interval_frames`, and `rewind = true` starts recording at launch
  (see [Configuration](configuration.md)). It shares its substrate with the
  debugger's reverse controls, so the same determinism caveats apply -- see
  [](../debugger/reverse).
- **Record Video** (also `Cmd+R` / `Alt+R`): starts a video-with-audio
  recording; the same item (or shortcut again) stops it. See below.
- **Record Input** (also `Cmd+Shift+R` / `Alt+Shift+R`): records every
  input event that reaches the emulated machine; stopping writes a script
  file that `--script` replays deterministically. See below.
- **Save State** (also `Cmd+Shift+S` / `Alt+Shift+S`) and **Load State...**
  (also `Cmd+Shift+L` / `Alt+Shift+L`): snapshot the whole emulated machine
  to a file, or restore one and continue from exactly that point. See below.
- **Quick Save** and **Quick Load** write and read one of ten numbered
  slots, with no dialog and no file to name. **Save Slot** picks which slot
  those two items use; the hotkeys reach any slot directly --
  `Cmd/Alt+<digit>` saves to it and `Cmd/Alt+Shift+<digit>` loads it, with
  `0` as the tenth. Addressing a slot from the keyboard also makes it the
  current one. See below.
- **Load Kickstart ROM...**: fit a different boot ROM. Pick a 512 KiB
  Kickstart, then optionally a second file for the extended ROM (512 KiB at
  $E00000 or 256 KiB at $F00000; Cancel to skip and remove any fitted
  extended ROM). The machine then cold-resets, as if the chip had been
  swapped and the power cycled.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts...**: the shortcut reference.
- **About...**: app version plus a summary of the emulated machine, and
  credits including Copperline's contributors and Patreon sponsors (see
  `CREDITS.md`). Builds
  made from an untagged git commit append the short commit ID to the version
  shown in the window title and About panel.

(machine-configuration-screen)=
## Machine configuration screen

Starting Copperline with no machine specified -- no `./copperline.toml`, no
`--config`, no ROM or override, and not a headless run -- opens the
configuration screen instead of booting. It is also available any time from the
menu's **Machine Configuration...** item, seeded with the running machine's
settings.

```{figure} ../images/ui-preview-launcher.png
:alt: The machine configuration screen
:width: 75%

The configuration screen: the machine selector across the top, category tabs
down the left, settings on the right, and the action bar along the bottom. Here
an A1200 is selected on the Memory tab; Zorro III RAM is greyed with the reason
"needs 32-bit CPU" (the A1200's 68EC020 has a 24-bit bus).
```

The layout is:

- **Machine selector** (top). Pick a machine -- A1000, A500 (OCS), A500, A500+,
  A600, A1200, A3000, A4000, CDTV, or CD32. With no profile chosen the A500 is
  highlighted,
  since that is the machine the defaults describe. Selecting a machine applies
  that profile's defaults (chipset, CPU, RAM, gate array, RTC) to every tab;
  settings that no longer apply (an IDE image on a machine with no IDE port, a
  CD image
  on a machine with no CD drive) are dropped so they cannot block a launch.
- **Category tabs** (left sidebar). *System* (chipset and Agnus/Denise
  overrides, video standard, RTC, identify board, RTG card), *CPU* (model,
  FPU, clock, caches), *Memory* (chip/fast/slow/motherboard/Zorro III RAM),
  *ROM*
  (Kickstart and
  extended ROM), *Floppy* (drive count and speed, then each wired drive as a
  greyed **DFn:** heading with its indented disk image and write-protect;
  drives that are not enabled are hidden rather than greyed),
  *Storage* (IDE master/slave, the SCSI controller -- A2091, A4091, or the
  A3000's onboard SCSI -- and its boot ROM and units; a row of buttons at the top
  links to three sub-pages: **CD** (image, insert delay, CD32 NVRAM); **Host
  Mounts**, for host directories served live as AmigaDOS volumes (up to four
  mounts, each with a boot priority and a read-write/read-only **Access** field
  -- the config file itself takes up to eight `[[filesys]]` mounts, of which the
  launcher edits the first four); and **Boot Priority**, which sets each
  hard-disk drive's synthesized-RDB boot priority (see below). Each sub-page has
  a **< Back** button in that top row that returns to Storage),
  *Input* (the controller device in each game port and the joystick input
  source),
  *I/O Ports* (the serial, parallel, and Ethernet ports under **Serial:** /
  **Parallel:** / **Ethernet:** headings, with each port's options indented
  beneath it: serial mode and MIDI endpoints; the
  parallel device -- None, Printer, or Sampler -- with, for the printer, its
  capture output file, or for the sampler, its host audio input and input gain;
  and the A2065 Ethernet board -- Not fitted, Isolated, Loopback, NAT, or
  Bridged; Bridged adds a host-adapter row. NAT and Bridged show a warning
  because host-clocked traffic makes input recordings and save-state replays
  non-reproducible while it flows),
  *Zorro* (extra autoconfig boards by metadata file, with a config panel for a
  WASM plugin board's declared options),
  and *A/V & Emu*, split by a row of category buttons at the top into
  **Audio** (output device, channel mode, stereo separation, filter, floppy
  sounds and volume), **Video** (start fullscreen, status bar, overscan, pixel
  aspect, screen tint, deinterlace, phosphor, CRT shader, shader strength and
  monitor bezel),
  and **Emulation**
  (power-on, warp speed, pacing, realtime priority) -- opening on Audio, and
  switched freely between the three.
- **Settings rows** (right pane). `[<]`/`[>]` step through a value, On/Off
  buttons flip a toggle, and the **Browse** and **Clear** buttons set or remove
  a file path through a native file dialog. On the *Storage* tab, once an IDE
  or SCSI drive has an image a small editable box appears next to **Browse**:
  click it and type to set the volume name for a directory mount (left blank, a
  directory mount inherits the host directory's name; the box has no effect on a
  raw HDF). A setting that does not apply to the chosen machine is greyed and
  shows why in place of its control -- "needs 32-bit CPU" for Zorro III RAM
  and the RTG card, "needs 68020+" for the FPU, "needs A600/A1200/A4000" for
  IDE.
- **Boot Priority sub-page** (from *Storage*). One row per hard-disk drive,
  under **Drive** / **Priority** / **Status** columns, setting the `de_BootPri`
  written into the partition Copperline synthesizes in front of a bare hardfile
  (it has no effect on an image carrying its own RDB). In the **Priority**
  column `[<]`/`[>]` nudge the value by one and the value box is also a text
  field -- click it and type any priority (-128..127), then Enter. The Status
  column's **Bootable** box is ticked by default; clearing it greys that row's
  priority and writes the -128 "disabled" sentinel, so the volume mounts but
  never boots.
  A drive with no image, or a CD image, is greyed ("no drive" / "CD-ROM").
  Drives you add here with no priority of their own cascade so they do not tie:
  the first is 0 (just under DF0:'s 5), and each later one drops below the
  floppies -- -35, -40, -45. A drive already carrying a priority in the config
  keeps it, and one that just names a device with no `bootpri` stays at 0. See
  [](configuration.md) for how the priority ranks against Kickstart's DF0: boot
  node at 5.
- **Action bar** (bottom). **Load...** and **Save...** read and write a `.toml`
  config
  through a file dialog (Save writes a minimal file, only the settings that
  differ from the chosen profile's defaults, so it reads like the example
  configs). **Defaults** resets to the selected profile. **Run** validates the
  configuration and boots it; if anything is wrong -- an unusable RAM size, a
  missing disk image, a ROM file that cannot be read, an option the chosen
  machine cannot use -- the reason is
  shown on the status line and you stay on the screen to fix it.

```{figure} ../images/ui-preview-launcher-boot-priority.png
:alt: The Boot Priority sub-page of the Storage tab
:width: 75%

The Boot Priority sub-page: an A1200 whose IDE master boots at priority 5, its
slave with the Bootable box cleared (priority greyed), and the empty SCSI units
greyed "no drive". A greyed **Info:** label heads a note on the valid priority
range.
```

Saved files use the same schema as a hand-written `copperline.toml`
(see [](configuration.md)), so the screen and the config file are
interchangeable: configure a machine and save it, or load an existing config to
tweak it. **Run** builds the machine in place, so the configuration screen and a
direct `--config` launch produce an identical machine.

## Recording video

`Cmd+R` on macOS or `Alt+R` on Linux/Windows (or the menu's "Record Video")
starts capturing the emulated display and sound to
`copperline-video-<YYYYMMDDHHmmSS>.avi` in the working directory; pressing it again
stops and finalizes the file. A red REC
badge sits in the display's top-right corner while a recording runs --
like the screenshot overlay, the badge, status bar, and menus are never
part of the captured video.

The file is an AVI with lossless ZMBV video (the DOSBox capture codec:
zlib-compressed keyframes plus frame deltas, which keeps typical Amiga
output to a few MB per minute) and uncompressed 16-bit stereo PCM audio
at 44.1 kHz. It plays directly in VLC, mpv, and anything else built on
ffmpeg; for other players, transcode with
`ffmpeg -i copperline-video-<ts>.avi out.mp4`.

Frames and audio are captured on the emulated timeline, not the host
clock: the recording stays in sync even when the host stutters, and a
capture made under Warp Speed plays back at normal speed. The audio
track is tapped before the status bar's volume slider, so recordings
keep full level regardless of the live output volume. Pausing (or
powering off) suspends the capture; recording resumes when emulation
continues.

## Recording input

`Cmd+Shift+R` on macOS or `Alt+Shift+R` on Linux/Windows (or the menu's
"Record Input") starts logging every input event that reaches the emulated
machine -- key presses with their hold times, mouse buttons and motion,
joystick / CD32-pad controls, analogue pot positions, and floppy inserts,
on whichever port carries each device -- each stamped
with its emulated time. Pressing it again stops the recording and writes
`copperline-input-<YYYYMMDDHHmmSS>.clscript` in the working directory: a plain
text file of scripted-input directives that
`copperline --script FILE` replays exactly, because the core is
deterministic and the events re-fire at the same emulated timestamps.

This is the direct way to turn "I can reproduce it by hand" into a
regression: play the sequence once while recording, then keep the script
(optionally together with a [save state](#save-states) to skip the
lead-in) as a deterministic, shareable reproduction. The format and the
headless `--record-input` variant are described in
[](headless.md#input-recording-and-script-files).

(save-states)=
## Save states

`Cmd+Shift+S` on macOS or `Alt+Shift+S` on Linux/Windows (or the menu's
"Save State") writes a snapshot of the whole emulated machine to
`copperline-state-<YYYYMMDDHHmmSS>.clstate` in the working directory: CPU,
chip/slow/fast RAM, ROM, the full chipset and CIA state, floppy images
(including unsaved in-memory changes), expansion boards, and CD/NVRAM
state. `Cmd+Shift+L` / `Alt+Shift+L` (or "Load State...") restores one; the
machine continues from exactly the saved point, byte-for-byte -- the core
is deterministic, so a resumed run is indistinguishable from one that was
never interrupted.

States are taken at emulated-frame boundaries and are versioned: a file
from an older, incompatible build is refused with a clear message rather
than producing a corrupt machine.

A state is self-contained: it carries its own RAM, ROM, and chipset, so
loading one always restores the machine it was taken on -- even if you
launched Copperline with a different config. When the loaded machine
differs from the running one -- a different model, chipset, video
standard, RAM size, or even a different Kickstart of the same machine
(the ROM is fingerprinted) -- the load reconfigures to match the state
and tells you so (the load message names the restored machine, e.g.
"reconfigured to A1200 / 68EC020 / AGA / PAL"); your current config is
not silently mixed in. Two caveats:

- Hard-drive images (HDF files) are referenced by path, not embedded.
  The state reopens the same file on load, so guest writes made to the
  hard drive *after* the snapshot are still visible after restoring --
  treat a state as a CPU/chipset snapshot, not a disk backup. In-memory
  volumes (directory-as-HDD) and floppy images are embedded whole.
- CD images are likewise reopened by path; keep the cue/bin where it was.

### Quick-save slots

Naming a file is the wrong interaction for the "before this jump" save you
take twenty times an hour, so there are ten numbered slots as well.
`Cmd/Alt+<digit>` saves to that slot and `Cmd/Alt+Shift+<digit>` loads it,
with `0` as the tenth; the **Quick Save** and **Quick Load** menu items do
the same for whichever slot **Save Slot** currently names (addressing a slot
from the keyboard also makes it the current one).

A quick save overwrites its slot without asking -- that is the point of it --
and loading a slot that has never been written reports "Slot N is empty"
rather than failing. Slots are ordinary `.clstate` files, identical in format
to a named save, kept per user rather than per working directory so they are
reachable however Copperline was launched:

| Host | Location |
|---|---|
| Linux/BSD | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/copperline/states/`, else `~/.config/copperline/states/` |
| macOS | `~/.config/copperline/states/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\copperline\states\` |

Because they are per user and not per machine, a slot may hold a state from
a different Amiga than the one running. That is safe: as above, the state
carries its own machine and the load reconfigures to match it and says so.

The headless flags `--save-state-after SECS PATH` and `--load-state PATH`
script the same feature for [debugging workflows](headless.md): snapshot a
long-running program just before the scene under investigation once, then
iterate from the state in seconds instead of re-emulating minutes. The
file format and what exactly is (and is not) captured are specified in
[the internals chapter](../internals/savestate.md).

## Controller ports

An Amiga has two game ports, and either accepts any controller. Copperline
models that: each port carries a device -- `mouse`, `joystick`, `cd32` pad,
`analogue` paddles, or `none` -- set with `[input] port1`/`port2` in the
config (or `--port1`/`--port2`, or the launcher's *Input* tab). The default
is the stock wiring, a mouse in port 1 and a joystick in port 2 (a CD32 pad
on the CD32 profile). The runtime menu's **Port 1 Device** / **Port 2
Device** items hot-plug a different device live, exactly like swapping the
physical plug: the old device's lines release, and the port's quadrature
counters hold.

The host mouse drives the (lowest-numbered) port with a mouse plugged in
and feeds its JOYxDAT counters. Click the display (or press `Cmd+G` on
macOS or `Alt+G` on Linux/Windows) to capture the host mouse; the same
shortcut releases it. The click that takes the capture is a window
action and is not passed to the Amiga, so the first click that reaches
the guest is the first one aimed at it -- otherwise a single click on a
gadget arrives as two, close enough together to read as a double click.

While an overlay panel is open, host cursor motion is not fed to the
emulated mouse. Tool windows likewise keep the debugger or analyzer
interaction separate from Amiga mouse input. A panel or tool window
opened while the mouse was captured borrows the cursor and hands the
capture back when the last of them closes, so a visit to the debugger
does not leave the machine uncaptured -- which matters most in
fullscreen, where there is no desktop to reach for. An explicit
`Cmd/Alt+G` release settles it the other way: the capture stays off.

Uncaptured, host cursor motion over the display still drives the
emulated mouse, and `[input] mouse_sensitivity` scales it the same way
it scales captured motion. At the default setting the factor is 1.0 and
the pointer tracks the host cursor one-for-one.

`[input] mouse_capture` (`--mouse-capture`, the launcher's *Input* tab)
changes when the grab is taken: `auto` grabs whenever the window has the
focus and on entering fullscreen, so no host cursor is ever loose over
the display, and `manual` grabs only on the shortcut, leaving display
clicks to go straight to the Amiga. See
[Mouse capture](configuration.md#mouse-capture).

A USB gamepad drives the emulated digital joystick on whichever port one is
plugged into: directions through JOYxDAT, fire through /FIRx, and a second
button through POTxY/POTGOR. A `cd32` device speaks the CD32 serial button
protocol instead, including the red/blue/green/yellow and transport
buttons, on either port. An `analogue` device presents pot resistances on
the POTxX/POTxY pins; no live host device maps to it yet -- drive it with
`--pot-after` scripting or the control protocol's `input.analogue`.

Copperline can also emulate the joystick from the host keyboard. There are
two explicit input modes, and the active one is always shown by the gamepad
/ keyboard icon in the status bar (next to the volume control), so a "my
keys aren't working" surprise can be spotted and fixed at a glance:

- **gamepad** (the default): use only a calibrated gamepad; every keyboard
  key passes through to the Amiga. With no pad connected there is no
  joystick input. This is the no-surprise mode for interactive AmigaOS
  setup.
- **keyboard**: use the keyboard-joystick mapping so the joystick port
  works without a controller.

With joysticks (or pads) in *both* ports -- a two-player setup -- the
gamepad and the cursor-key mapping drive one port each, and the mode picks
which source gets the lower-numbered port. Whenever no physical pad is
present, a second keyboard mapping on the numeric keypad stands in for it,
so two players can share one keyboard.

With mice in both ports, the host mouse drives the lower-numbered one and
the cursor-key mapping drives the second as an emulated mouse (in
`keyboard` mode; in `gamepad` mode the second mouse is undriven and the
keyboard passes through). The same applies whenever the keyboard-routed
port carries a mouse: the mapping's keys become the pointer.

Click the status-bar icon to flip between them; the menu's **Joystick Input**
item and `Cmd+J` on macOS / `Alt+J` on Linux and Windows do the same. Set the
starting mode with `[input] joystick` in the config (or `--joystick MODE`, or
the launcher's *Input* tab).

The primary keyboard mapping is FS-UAE-compatible: cursor keys for
directions, and Right Ctrl, Right Alt or Left Ctrl for fire, with Left
Alt as the second button (the left-hand fire keys pair naturally with the
right-hand arrows, and compact keyboards often lack the right-side
modifiers). For CD32 pad buttons, `C` is red/fire, `X` is blue, `D` is
green, `S` is yellow, Return is play/pause, `Z` is rewind, and `A` is
forward. On a mouse port the same keys drive the pointer: cursor keys
move it, the fire keys are the left button, `X` or Left Alt the right,
and `D` the middle. The second (numpad) mapping is
`8`/`2`/`4`/`6` for directions, `0` for fire, `.` for the second button,
and numpad Enter for play. While a mapping owns its keys, they are not
sent to the Amiga keyboard.

Those are the defaults; every binding is editable from the menu's **Input
Mapping...** item (see [](#input-mapping)). A held fire button can also be
turned into a pulse train with the **Autofire** item or `[input]
autofire_hz`.

## Gamepad calibration

Pads are read through raw `gilrs` events with no controller database, so
each controller is calibrated once: push each control when prompted. This
records raw axis/button codes and directions, which makes any pad work
regardless of database coverage and handles inverted or odd axis layouts
automatically.

```{figure} ../images/ui-preview-calibration.png
:alt: The gamepad calibration window
:width: 75%

The calibration window mid-flow. Skip covers pads without the CD32 extras.
```

Run it either from the menu ("Calibrate Gamepad...") -- which ends with a
live test of the finished bindings and a Save button that makes them live
immediately -- or from the terminal with `copperline --calibrate-gamepad`.
The steps are the four directions, fire (CD32 red), button 2 (CD32 blue),
and the optional CD32 green/yellow/play/rewind/forward buttons; every step
waits for the pad to return to neutral before sampling, so a held control
cannot bleed into the next binding.

Calibrations are saved per controller UUID in
`~/.config/copperline/gamepads.toml` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` respected;
`%APPDATA%\copperline\` on Windows).

## Input mapping

The keyboard also stands in for a controller, on two independent mappings so
one keyboard can drive a two-player setup (see [](#controller-ports)). The
menu's **Input Mapping...** item edits both.

```{figure} ../images/ui-preview-input-mapping.png
:alt: The input mapping window
:width: 75%

Editing the first keyboard mapping, with the Fire row armed for capture.
```

Pick the mapping with the **Controller 1** / **Controller 2** tabs, then
**Set** on a row and press the key to bind (Escape cancels that row without
closing the panel). **Clear** unbinds a control entirely, **Defaults**
restores the built-in layouts, and **Save** writes the map and applies it to
the running machine. Closing the window discards the edits.

A control may hold several keys, and they OR together: fire ships bound to
Right Ctrl, Right Alt, Left Ctrl and `C`, so compact keyboards without the
right-hand modifiers still work, and releasing one alias while another is
held keeps the button down. Binding a key removes it from wherever it was
before -- including from the other mapping -- so the two controllers can
never end up fighting over one key.

Saved maps live next to the gamepad calibrations, in
`~/.config/copperline/keymap.toml` (same per-platform locations as above).
Deleting the file restores the defaults.
